images. In this paper we investigate whether they can also be leveraged for AD
on multivariate time series (MTS). We test two diffusion-based models and
compare them to several strong neural baselines. We also extend the PA%K
protocol, by computing a ROCK-AUC metric, which is agnostic to both the
detection threshold and the ratio K of correctly detected points. Our models
outperform the baselines on synthetic datasets and are competitive on
real-world datasets, illustrating the potential of diffusion-based methods for
AD in multivariate time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01452v1,cs.LG

results in various domains, including time series forecasting. While existing
time series literature primarily focuses on model architecture modifications
and data augmentation techniques, this paper explores the training schema of
deep learning models for time series; how models are trained regardless of
their architecture. We perform extensive experiments to investigate the
occurrence of deep double descent in several Transformer models trained on
public time series data sets. We demonstrate epoch-wise deep double descent and
that overfitting can be reverted using more epochs. Leveraging these findings,
we achieve state-of-the-art results for long sequence time series forecasting
in nearly 70% of the 72 benchmarks tested. This suggests that many models in
the literature may possess untapped potential. Additionally, we introduce a
taxonomy for classifying training schema modifications, covering data
augmentation, model inputs, model targets, time series per model, and
computational budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01442v1,cs.LG
2023-11-02 17:26:49+00:00,Castor: Causal Temporal Regime Structure Learning,"['Abdellah Rahmani', 'Pascal Frossard']","The task of uncovering causal relationships among multivariate time series
data stands as an essential and challenging objective that cuts across a broad
array of disciplines ranging from climate science to healthcare. Such data
entails linear or non-linear relationships, and usually follow multiple a
priori unknown regimes. Existing causal discovery methods can infer summary
causal graphs from heterogeneous data with known regimes, but they fall short
in comprehensively learning both regimes and the corresponding causal graph. In
this paper, we introduce CASTOR, a novel framework designed to learn causal
relationships in heterogeneous time series data composed of various regimes,
each governed by a distinct causal graph. Through the maximization of a score
function via the EM algorithm, CASTOR infers the number of regimes and learns
linear or non-linear causal relationships in each regime. We demonstrate the
robust convergence properties of CASTOR, specifically highlighting its
proficiency in accurately identifying unique regimes. Empirical evidence,
garnered from exhaustive synthetic experiments and two real-world benchmarks,
confirm CASTOR's superior performance in causal discovery compared to baseline
methods. By learning a full temporal causal graph for each regime, CASTOR
establishes itself as a distinctly interpretable method for causal discovery in
heterogeneous time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01412v1,cs.LG

positive data pairs that, when pushed together in embedding space, encode
useful information for subsequent downstream tasks. However, in time-series,
this is challenging because creating positive pairs via augmentations may break
the original semantic meaning. We hypothesize that if we can retrieve
information from one subsequence to successfully reconstruct another
subsequence, then they should form a positive pair. Harnessing this intuition,
we introduce our novel approach: REtrieval-BAsed Reconstruction (REBAR)
contrastive learning. First, we utilize a convolutional cross-attention
architecture to calculate the REBAR error between two different time-series.
Then, through validation experiments, we show that the REBAR error is a
predictor of mutual class membership, justifying its usage as a
positive/negative labeler. Finally, once integrated into a contrastive learning
framework, our REBAR method can learn an embedding that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across various modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00519v1,cs.LG

state-of-the-art time series forecasting results, but they suffer from high
computational costs and the inability to capture the long and short periodicity
of time series. We present a highly accurate and simply structured CNN-based
model for long-term time series forecasting tasks, called WinNet, including (i)
Inter-Intra Period Encoder (I2PE) to transform 1D sequence into 2D tensor with
long and short periodicity according to the predefined periodic window, (ii)
Two-Dimensional Period Decomposition (TDPD) to model period-trend and
oscillation terms, and (iii) Decomposition Correlation Block (DCB) to leverage
the correlations of the period-trend and oscillation terms to support the
prediction tasks by CNNs. Results on nine benchmark datasets show that the
WinNet can achieve SOTA performance and lower computational complexity over
CNN-, MLP-, Transformer-based approaches. The WinNet provides potential for the
CNN-based methods in the time series forecasting tasks, with perfect tradeoff
between performance and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00214v1,cs.LG
2023-10-31 14:34:00+00:00,BasisFormer: Attention-based Time Series Forecasting with Learnable and Interpretable Basis,"['Zelin Ni', 'Hang Yu', 'Shizhan Liu', 'Jianguo Li', 'Weiyao Lin']","Bases have become an integral part of modern deep learning-based models for
time series forecasting due to their ability to act as feature extractors or
future references. To be effective, a basis must be tailored to the specific
set of time series data and exhibit distinct correlation with each time series
within the set. However, current state-of-the-art methods are limited in their
ability to satisfy both of these requirements simultaneously. To address this
challenge, we propose BasisFormer, an end-to-end time series forecasting
architecture that leverages learnable and interpretable bases. This
architecture comprises three components: First, we acquire bases through
adaptive self-supervised learning, which treats the historical and future
sections of the time series as two distinct views and employs contrastive
learning. Next, we design a Coef module that calculates the similarity
coefficients between the time series and bases in the historical view via
bidirectional cross-attention. Finally, we present a Forecast module that
selects and consolidates the bases in the future view based on the similarity
coefficients, resulting in accurate future predictions. Through extensive
experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that BasisFormer outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods by 11.04\% and 15.78\% respectively for
univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks. Code is available at:

measurements that reflect properties of human, animal, industrial, commercial,
and natural processes. Shifts in such processes, e.g. caused by external events
or internal state changes, manifest as changes in the recorded signals. The
task of streaming time series segmentation (STSS) is to partition the stream
into consecutive variable-sized segments that correspond to states of the
observed processes or entities. The partition operation itself must in
performance be able to cope with the input frequency of the signals. We
introduce ClaSS, a novel, efficient, and highly accurate algorithm for STSS.
ClaSS assesses the homogeneity of potential partitions using self-supervised
time series classification and applies statistical tests to detect significant
change points (CPs). In our experimental evaluation using two large benchmarks
and six real-world data archives, we found ClaSS to be significantly more
precise than eight state-of-the-art competitors. Its space and time complexity
is independent of segment sizes and linear only in the sliding window size. We
also provide ClaSS as a window operator with an average throughput of 538 data
points per second for the Apache Flink streaming engine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20431v1,cs.LG

Nguyen', 'Pankaj Dayama', 'Renuka Sindhgatta', 'Prateeti Mohapatra', 'Harshit Kumar', 'Jayant Kalagnanam', 'Nandyala Hemachandra', 'Narayan Rangaraj']","The efficiency of business processes relies on business key performance
indicators (Biz-KPIs), that can be negatively impacted by IT failures. Business
and IT Observability (BizITObs) data fuses both Biz-KPIs and IT event channels
together as multivariate time series data. Forecasting Biz-KPIs in advance can
enhance efficiency and revenue through proactive corrective measures. However,
BizITObs data generally exhibit both useful and noisy inter-channel
interactions between Biz-KPIs and IT events that need to be effectively
decoupled. This leads to suboptimal forecasting performance when existing
multivariate forecasting models are employed. To address this, we introduce
AutoMixer, a time-series Foundation Model (FM) approach, grounded on the novel
technique of channel-compressed pretrain and finetune workflows. AutoMixer
leverages an AutoEncoder for channel-compressed pretraining and integrates it
with the advanced TSMixer model for multivariate time series forecasting. This
fusion greatly enhances the potency of TSMixer for accurate forecasts and also
generalizes well across several downstream tasks. Through detailed experiments
and dashboard analytics, we show AutoMixer's capability to consistently improve
the Biz-KPI's forecasting accuracy (by 11-15\%) which directly translates to
actionable business insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20280v2,cs.LG

series forecasting (TSF). Transformer architectures, in particular, have
witnessed broad utilization and adoption in TSF tasks. Transformers have proven
to be the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among
the elements within a long sequence. Various variants have enabled transformer
architecture to effectively handle long-term time series forecasting (LTSF)
tasks. In this article, we first present a comprehensive overview of
transformer architectures and their subsequent enhancements developed to
address various LTSF tasks. Then, we summarize the publicly available LTSF
datasets and relevant evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide valuable
insights into the best practices and techniques for effectively training
transformers in the context of time-series analysis. Lastly, we propose
potential research directions in this rapidly evolving field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20218v1,cs.LG

time-series questions. For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can
be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be
visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive
coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode
long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper,
we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding
that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the
amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this
representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for
goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL
methods, ours achieves $2 \times$ median improvement in success rates and can
better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our
method is about $20 \times$ more sample efficient than the successor
representation and $1500 \times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte
Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20141v1,cs.LG

this paper, we attempt to incorporate topological information into a multiple
output Gaussian process model for transfer learning purposes. To achieve this
goal, we extend the framework of circular coordinates into a novel framework of
mixed valued coordinates to take linear trends in the time series into
consideration.
  One of the major challenges to learn from multiple time series effectively
via a multiple output Gaussian process model is constructing a functional
kernel. We propose to use topologically induced clustering to construct a
cluster based kernel in a multiple output Gaussian process model. This kernel
not only incorporates the topological structural information, but also allows
us to put forward a unified framework using topological information in time and
motion series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19960v1,cs.LG
2023-10-30 06:10:00+00:00,AMLNet: Adversarial Mutual Learning Neural Network for Non-AutoRegressive Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting,['Yang Lin'],"Multi-horizon time series forecasting, crucial across diverse domains,
demands high accuracy and speed. While AutoRegressive (AR) models excel in
short-term predictions, they suffer speed and error issues as the horizon
extends. Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) models suit long-term predictions but
struggle with interdependence, yielding unrealistic results. We introduce
AMLNet, an innovative NAR model that achieves realistic forecasts through an
online Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach. AMLNet harnesses the strengths of
both AR and NAR models by training a deep AR decoder and a deep NAR decoder in
a collaborative manner, serving as ensemble teachers that impart knowledge to a
shallower NAR decoder. This knowledge transfer is facilitated through two key
mechanisms: 1) outcome-driven KD, which dynamically weights the contribution of
KD losses from the teacher models, enabling the shallow NAR decoder to
incorporate the ensemble's diversity; and 2) hint-driven KD, which employs
adversarial training to extract valuable insights from the model's hidden
states for distillation. Extensive experimentation showcases AMLNet's
superiority over conventional AR and NAR models, thereby presenting a promising
avenue for multi-horizon time series forecasting that enhances accuracy and
expedites computation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19289v1,cs.LG

decision support*, and the recent explosion in ML research has demonstrated
great potential in various healthcare settings. At the same time, medical
time-series problems in the wild are challenging due to their highly
*composite* nature: They entail design choices and interactions among
components that preprocess data, impute missing values, select features, issue
predictions, estimate uncertainty, and interpret models. Despite exponential
growth in electronic patient data, there is a remarkable gap between the
potential and realized utilization of ML for clinical research and decision
support. In particular, orchestrating a real-world project lifecycle poses
challenges in engineering (i.e. hard to build), evaluation (i.e. hard to
assess), and efficiency (i.e. hard to optimize). Designed to address these
issues simultaneously, Clairvoyance proposes a unified, end-to-end,
autoML-friendly pipeline that serves as a (i) software toolkit, (ii) empirical
standard, and (iii) interface for optimization. Our ultimate goal lies in
facilitating transparent and reproducible experimentation with complex
inference workflows, providing integrated pathways for (1) personalized
prediction, (2) treatment-effect estimation, and (3) information acquisition.
Through illustrative examples on real-world data in outpatient, general wards,

observed data. For time series data, there is a variety of methods, however, it
is difficult to evaluate these on real data as realistic use cases very rarely

we present a dataset from an industrial subsystem at the European Spallation

popular tool used for differing brain regions by measuring brain activity. It
is affected by physiological noise, such as head and brain movement in the
scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting. The purpose of
this paper is to propose a novel approach to handling fMRI data for infants
with high volatility caused by sudden head movements. Another purpose is to
evaluate the volatility modelling performance of multiple dependent fMRI time
series data. The models examined in this paper are AR and GARCH and the
modelling performance is evaluated by several statistical performance measures.
The conclusions of this paper are that multiple dependent fMRI series data can
be fitted with AR + GARCH model if the multiple fMRI data have many sudden head
movements. The GARCH model can capture the shared volatility clustering caused
by head movements across brain regions. However, the multiple fMRI data without
many head movements have fitted AR + GARCH model with different performance.
The conclusions are supported by statistical tests and measures. This paper
highlights the difference between the proposed approach from traditional
approaches when estimating model parameters and modelling conditional variances
on multiple dependent time series. In the future, the proposed approach can be
applied to other research fields, such as financial economics, and signal
processing. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/13204942/STAT40710}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17760v1,stat.ME

of anomaly detection methods, including more recently, deep learning based
methods. Although several benchmarks have been proposed to compare newly
developed models, they usually rely on one-time execution over a limited set of
datasets and the comparison is restricted to a few models. We propose
OrionBench -- a user centric continuously maintained benchmark for unsupervised
time series anomaly detection. The framework provides universal abstractions to
represent models, extensibility to add new pipelines and datasets,
hyperparameter standardization, pipeline verification, and frequent releases
with published benchmarks. We demonstrate the usage of OrionBench, and the
progression of pipelines across 15 releases published over the course of three

subsequences using a sliding window. Then a generator and a discriminator
designed based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are employed to capture the
temporal correlations of the time series data. To avoid the local optimal
solution of loss function and the model collapse, we introduce an exponential
information measure into the loss function of GAN. Additionally, a discriminant
reconstruction score consisting on discrimination and reconstruction loss is
taken into account. The global optimal solution for the loss function is
derived and the model collapse is proved to be avoided in our proposed

representations of time series data by automatically identifying complex

other hand, Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) methods allow the creation
of symbolic representations that can be interpreted but do not capture complex

neural representation of univariate time series to be interpretable. We propose
a new unsupervised neural architecture that meets these requirements. The
proposed model produces consistent, discrete, interpretable, and visualizable

an unsupervised setting to ensure robustness. As a demonstration of the
effectiveness of the proposed model, we propose experiments on classification
tasks using UCR archive datasets. The obtained results are extensively compared

finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and science. Accurately identifying events
in time series data is vital for making informed decisions, detecting
anomalies, and predicting future trends. Despite extensive research exploring
diverse methods for event detection in time series, with deep learning
approaches being among the most advanced, there is still room for improvement
and innovation in this field. In this paper, we present a new deep learning
supervised method for detecting events in multivariate time series data. Our
method combines four distinct novelties compared to existing deep-learning
supervised methods. Firstly, it is based on regression instead of binary
classification. Secondly, it does not require labeled datasets where each point
is labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time points
or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be robust by using a stacked
ensemble learning meta-model that combines deep learning models, ranging from
classic feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) to state-of-the-art architectures
like transformers. This ensemble approach can mitigate individual model
weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions. Finally, to
facilitate practical implementation, we have developed a Python package to
accompany our proposed method. The package, called eventdetector-ts, can be
installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). In this paper, we present
our method and provide a comprehensive guide on the usage of the package. We

an ensemble of predictive models and pool their output into an ensemble
forecast. In cases where each predictive model has different biases, however,
it is not always clear exactly how each model forecast should be weighed during
this pooling. We propose a method for pooling that performs a weighted average
over candidate model forecasts, where the weights are learned by an
attention-based ensemble pooling model. We test this method on two time-series
forecasting problems: multi-step forecasting of the dynamics of the
non-stationary Lorenz `63 equation, and one-step forecasting of the weekly
incident deaths due to COVID-19. We find that while our model achieves
excellent valid times when forecasting the non-stationary Lorenz `63 equation,

collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional
multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage
of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic)
graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form
of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture,
resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph
neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global
forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time
localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by
accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed,
recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep
learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing
frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature
focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking
advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and
methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To
fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological
framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design
principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their
performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we

Various forecasting approaches have been proposed for improving STLF, including
neural network (NN) models which are trained using data from multiple
electricity demand series that may not necessary include the target series. In
the present study, we investigate the performance of this special case of STLF,
called transfer learning (TL), by considering a set of 27 time series that
represent the national day-ahead electricity demand of indicative European
countries. We employ a popular and easy-to-implement NN model and perform a
clustering analysis to identify similar patterns among the series and assist
TL. In this context, two different TL approaches, with and without the

variety of patterns that can occur. One major difficulty arises from modeling
time-dependent relationships to find contextual anomalies while maintaining
detection accuracy for point anomalies. In this paper, we propose a framework
for unsupervised time series anomaly detection that utilizes point-based and
sequence-based reconstruction models. The point-based model attempts to
quantify point anomalies, and the sequence-based model attempts to quantify
both point and contextual anomalies. Under the formulation that the observed
time point is a two-stage deviated value from a nominal time point, we
introduce a nominality score calculated from the ratio of a combined value of
the reconstruction errors. We derive an induced anomaly score by further
integrating the nominality score and anomaly score, then theoretically prove
the superiority of the induced anomaly score over the original anomaly score

series classification (TSC), it remains unclear how to evaluate different
explainability methods. Resorting to qualitative assessment and user studies to
evaluate explainers for TSC is difficult since humans have difficulties
understanding the underlying information contained in time series data.
Therefore, a systematic review and quantitative comparison of explanation
methods to confirm their correctness becomes crucial. While steps to
standardized evaluations were taken for tabular, image, and textual data,
benchmarking explainability methods on time series is challenging due to a)
traditional metrics not being directly applicable, b) implementation and
adaption of traditional metrics for time series in the literature vary, and c)
varying baseline implementations. This paper proposes XTSC-Bench, a

can have a significant impact on both performance and training efficiency. This
is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series
prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit
irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model
performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately
addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input
Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to
appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an
end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is
achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep
neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using
synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit

handling various types of time series. Numerous studies have explored the
improvement of HMM using advanced techniques, leading to the development of
several variations of HMM. Despite these studies indicating the increased
competitiveness of HMM compared to other advanced algorithms, few have
recognized the significance and impact of incorporating multistep stochastic
states into its performance. In this work, we propose a Pyramidal Hidden Markov
Model (PHMM) that can capture multiple multistep stochastic states. Initially,
a multistep HMM is designed for extracting short multistep stochastic states.
Next, a novel time series forecasting structure is proposed based on PHMM,
which utilizes pyramid-like stacking to adaptively identify long multistep
stochastic states. By employing these two schemes, our model can effectively
handle non-stationary and noisy data, while also establishing long-term
dependencies for more accurate and comprehensive forecasting. The experimental

COMET, an innovative hierarchical framework that leverages data consistencies

systematically captures data consistency from four potential levels:
observation, sample, trial, and patient levels. By developing contrastive loss
at multiple levels, we can learn effective representations that preserve
comprehensive data consistency, maximizing information utilization in a
self-supervised manner. We conduct experiments in the challenging
patient-independent setting. We compare COMET against six baselines using three
diverse datasets, which include ECG signals for myocardial infarction and EEG

known for a long time that unit root tests may be flawed when a series although
stationary has a root close to unity. That motivated recent papers dedicated to
autoregressive processes where the bridge between stability and instability is
expressed by means of time-varying coefficients. In this vein the process we
consider has a companion matrix $A_{n}$ with spectral radius $\rho(A_{n}) < 1$
satisfying $\rho(A_{n}) \rightarrow 1$, a situation that we describe as `nearly
unstable'. The question we investigate is the following: given an observed path
supposed to come from a nearly-unstable process, is it possible to test for the
`extent of instability', \textit{i.e.} to test how close we are to the unit
root? In this regard, we develop a strategy to evaluate $\alpha$ and to test
for $\mathcal{H}_0 : ""\alpha = \alpha_0""$ against $\mathcal{H}_1 : ""\alpha >
\alpha_0""$ when $\rho(A_{n})$ lies in an inner $O(n^{-\alpha})$-neighborhood of
the unity, for some $0 < \alpha < 1$. Empirical evidence is given (on
simulations and real time series) about the advantages of the flexibility

insights for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. The
exponential growth in data complexity, driven by advanced sensor technologies,
has presented challenges related to data labeling. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges,
eliminating the need for extensive human annotation. In this study, we
introduce a novel framework for Medical Time Series Representation Learning,
known as MTS-LOF. MTS-LOF leverages the strengths of contrastive learning and
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods, offering a unique approach to representation
learning for medical time series data. By combining these techniques, MTS-LOF
enhances the potential of healthcare applications by providing more
sophisticated, context-rich representations. Additionally, MTS-LOF employs a
multi-masking strategy to facilitate occlusion-invariant feature learning. This
approach allows the model to create multiple views of the data by masking
portions of it. By minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of
these masked patches and the fully visible patches, MTS-LOF learns to capture
rich contextual information within medical time series datasets. The results of
experiments conducted on diverse medical time series datasets demonstrate the
superiority of MTS-LOF over other methods. These findings hold promise for
significantly enhancing healthcare applications by improving representation
learning. Furthermore, our work delves into the integration of joint-embedding

primarily considers CD and CI as two complementary yet mutually exclusive
approaches, unable to harness these two extremes simultaneously. And it is also
a challenging issue that both CD and CI are static strategies that cannot be
determined to be optimal for a specific dataset without extensive experiments.
In this paper, we reconsider whether the current CI strategy is the best

Self-Clustering (CSC) enhances CI strategy's performance improvements while
reducing parameter size, for exmpale by over 10 times on electricity dataset,

monitor the behavior of technical systems by means of sensor data. In the
automotive industry, these methods are in high demand for tracing events in
time series data. For assessing the active vehicle safety systems, a diverse
range of driving scenarios is conducted. These scenarios involve the recording
of the vehicle's behavior using external sensors, enabling the evaluation of
operational performance. In such setting, automated detection methods not only
accelerate but also standardize and objectify the evaluation by avoiding
subjective, human-based appraisals in the data inspection. This work proposes a
novel event detection method that allows to identify frequency-based events in

representations in the time-frequency domain, known as scalograms. After
filtering scalograms to enhance relevant parts of the signal, an object
detection model is trained to detect the desired event objects in the
scalograms. For the analysis of unseen time series data, events can be detected
in their scalograms with the trained object detection model and are thereafter
mapped back to the time series data to mark the corresponding time interval.
The algorithm, evaluated on unseen datasets, achieves a precision rate of 0.97

finance, healthcare, and sensor data analysis. Unsupervised contrastive
learning has garnered significant interest in learning effective
representations from time series data with limited labels. The prevalent
approach in existing contrastive learning methods consists of two separate
stages: pre-training the encoder on unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning the
well-trained model on a small-scale labeled dataset. However, such two-stage
approaches suffer from several shortcomings, such as the inability of
unsupervised pre-training contrastive loss to directly affect downstream
fine-tuning classifiers, and the lack of exploiting the classification loss
which is guided by valuable ground truth. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end model called SLOTS (Semi-supervised Learning fOr Time

recent years for detecting anomalies in time series data. However, due to the
rapid increase in data scale and dimensionality, the issues of noise and Weak

forecasting models have gained popularity as they can utilize hidden feature
patterns in time series to improve forecasting performance. Nevertheless, the
majority of current deep forecasting models are opaque, hence making it
challenging to interpret the results. While counterfactual explanations have
been extensively employed as a post-hoc approach for explaining classification
models, their application to forecasting models still remains underexplored. In
this paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for
time series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that
solves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original
time series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the
forecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes. We experimentally
evaluate ForecastCF using four state-of-the-art deep model architectures and
compare to two baselines. Our results show that ForecastCF outperforms the
baseline in terms of counterfactual validity and data manifold closeness.
Overall, our findings suggest that ForecastCF can generate meaningful and
relevant counterfactual explanations for various forecasting tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08137v1,cs.LG

series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach,
we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can
surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or
exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the
downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for
effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions
over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the
success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent
multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and
repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as
repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing
data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side
information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find
that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we
show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers,
and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment
interventions such as RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820v1,cs.LG

applications in weather forecasting, traffic control, and stock price
prediction. Extreme values in time series often significantly impact human and
natural systems, but predicting them is challenging due to their rare
occurrence. Statistical methods based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provide a
systematic approach to modeling the distribution of extremes, particularly the
Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution for modeling the distribution of
exceedances beyond a threshold. To overcome the subpar performance of deep
learning in dealing with heavy-tailed data, we propose a novel framework to
enhance the focus on extreme events. Specifically, we propose a Deep Extreme
Mixture Model with Autoencoder (DEMMA) for time series prediction. The model
comprises two main modules: 1) a generalized mixture distribution based on the
Hurdle model and a reparameterized GP distribution form independent of the
extreme threshold, 2) an Autoencoder-based LSTM feature extractor and a
quantile prediction module with a temporal attention mechanism. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on multiple real-world rainfall datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07435v1,cs.LG

Field (QGAF). This approach merges the advantages of quantum computing
technology with deep learning, aiming to enhance the precision of time series

series data into two-dimensional images suitable for Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) training by designing specific quantum circuits. Distinct from
the classical Gramian Angular Field (GAF) approach, QGAF's uniqueness lies in
eliminating the need for data normalization and inverse cosine calculations,
simplifying the transformation process from time series data to two-dimensional

on datasets from three major stock markets: the China A-share market, the Hong
Kong stock market, and the US stock market. Experimental results revealed that
compared to the classical GAF method, the QGAF approach significantly improved

literature for analyzing a vector time series. However, this assumption is
either too restrictive for a real-life time series to satisfy or is hard to
verify through a hypothesis test. This paper performs statistical inference on
a sparse high-dimensional vector autoregressive time series, allowing its white
noise innovations to be dependent, even non-stationary. To achieve this goal,
it adopts a post-selection estimator to fit the vector autoregressive model and
derives the asymptotic distribution of the post-selection estimator. The
innovations in the autoregressive time series are not assumed to be
independent, thus making the covariance matrices of the autoregressive
coefficient estimators complex and difficult to estimate. Our work develops a
bootstrap algorithm to facilitate practitioners in performing statistical
inference without having to engage in sophisticated calculations. Simulations
and real-life data experiments reveal the validity of the proposed methods and
theoretical results.
  Real-life data is rarely considered to exactly satisfy an autoregressive

for architectural modifications of Transformer-based forecasters. These
forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over
temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of
the same timestamp. However, Transformer is challenged in forecasting series
with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation
explosion. Besides, the unified embedding for each temporal token fuses
multiple variates with potentially unaligned timestamps and distinct physical
measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and
result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent
duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture
without any adaptation on the basic components. We propose iTransformer that
simply inverts the duties of the attention mechanism and the feed-forward
network. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into
variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture
multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for
each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model
achieves consistent state-of-the-art on several real-world datasets, which
further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance,
generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of
arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental
backbone of time series forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06625v1,cs.LG

causal relationships from time series data poses a formidable challenge. While
contemporary techniques can handle nonlinear relationships between variables
and flexible noise distributions, they rely on the simplifying assumption that
data originates from the same underlying causal model. In this work, we relax
this assumption and perform causal discovery from time series data originating
from mixtures of different causal models. We infer both the underlying
structural causal models and the posterior probability for each sample
belonging to a specific mixture component. Our approach employs an end-to-end
training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound for data likelihood.
Through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we

witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such
as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops
where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering
the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity,
introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions.
Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains,
performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series
forecasting from a machine-learning perspective.
  In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS),
addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced
distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature
Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to
anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly.
We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to
reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The

adapted and applied the causal-graphical-model framework to time series data.
Many of these works employ time-resolved causal graphs that extend infinitely
into the past and future and whose edges are repetitive in time, thereby
reflecting the assumption of stationary causal relationships. However, most
results and algorithms from the causal-graphical-model framework are not
designed for infinite graphs. In this work, we develop a method for projecting
infinite time series graphs with repetitive edges to marginal graphical models
on a finite time window. These finite marginal graphs provide the answers to
$m$-separation queries with respect to the infinite graph, a task that was
previously unresolved. Moreover, we argue that these marginal graphs are useful
for causal discovery and causal effect estimation in time series, effectively
enabling to apply results developed for finite graphs to the infinite graphs.
The projection procedure relies on finding common ancestors in the
to-be-projected graph and is, by itself, not new. However, the projection
procedure has not yet been algorithmically implemented for time series graphs
since in these infinite graphs there can be infinite sets of paths that might
give rise to common ancestors. We solve the search over these possibly infinite
sets of paths by an intriguing combination of path-finding techniques for
finite directed graphs and solution theory for linear Diophantine equations. By
providing an algorithm that carries out the projection, our paper makes an
important step towards a theoretically-grounded and method-agnostic
generalization of a range of causal inference methods and results to time

Successive Data Injection (SuDaI). In this approach, we explore a larger
portion of the quantum state than that in the conventional angle encoding, the
method used predominantly in the literature, through repeated data injections
into the quantum state. SuDaI encoding allows us to adapt the QGAN for anomaly
detection with network data of a much higher dimensionality than with the
existing known QGANs implementations. In addition, SuDaI encoding applies to
other types of high-dimensional time series and can be used in contexts beyond

essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i)
decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual

distribution adaptation in non-stationary time series. TEMPO expands the
capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data

TEMPO over state-of-the-art methods on a number of time series benchmark

vector embeddings of time alongside its feature extractor, to extract temporal
features such as trend, periodicity, or distribution shifts from the signal.
These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and
fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce
robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification,

scientific applications. Existing work tackles this problem using generative
adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are often unstable during training,
and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs)
are known to be more robust to these issues, they are (surprisingly) less often
considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE
(KVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the
model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular
training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional
prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling
with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved
by leverageing spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of
the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stablity of the
system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results
show that KVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several
challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether
trained on regular or irregular data, KVAE generates time series that improve
both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence

The pipeline starts from real observations in a specific scenario and produces
a matching benchmark dataset. Firstly, we harness deep neural networks along
with normalizing flow to accurately capture realistic dynamics. Secondly, we
extract hypothesized causal graphs by performing importance analysis on the
neural network or leveraging prior knowledge. Thirdly, we derive the ground

term, and noise term. Lastly, using the fitted network and the derived causal
graph, we generate corresponding versatile time-series proper for algorithm
assessment. In the experiments, we validate the fidelity of the generated data
through qualitative and quantitative experiments, followed by a benchmarking of
existing TSCD algorithms using these generated datasets. CausalTime offers a
feasible solution to evaluating TSCD algorithms in real applications and can be

pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their
development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity.
Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust
pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens.
However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time

we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general
time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin
by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it
into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability
to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which
enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input

the key challenge lies in constructing a reliable time series forecasting model
capable of harnessing data from diverse sources and extracting valuable
insights to predict the target time series accurately. In this work, we tackle
this challenging problem and introduce a novel multimodal transformer-based
model named the Modality-aware Transformer. Our model excels in exploring the

second, a set of invertible and Lipschitz continuous nonlinear mappings that
are applied per sensor, that is, a component-wise mapping from each latent
variable to a variable in the measurement space. The VAR coefficient
identification provides a topology representation of the dependencies among the
aforementioned variables. The proposed approach models each component-wise
nonlinearity using an invertible neural network and imposes sparsity on the VAR

custom algorithm is devised combining proximal gradient descent, stochastic
primal-dual updates, and projection to enforce the corresponding constraints.

biased random walk-based spatial masking and patch-based temporal masking.
Subsequently, the decoders aim to reconstruct the masked counterparts from both
spatial and temporal perspectives. The pretraining stage establishes a
challenging pretext task, compelling the encoder to learn robust
spatial-temporal patterns. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained encoder is

warping transformations as a means of overcoming the shortcomings of DTW-based

augmentation. Although the degree of data augmentations has been well
controlled by utilizing pre-defined techniques in some domains like vision,
time-series data augmentation is less explored and remains a challenging
problem due to the complexity of the data generation mechanism, such as the
intricate mechanism involved in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, there is
no widely recognized and general time-series augmentation method that can be
applied across different tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data
augmentation method for quasi-periodic time-series tasks that aims to connect
intra-class samples together, and thereby find order in the latent space. Our
method builds upon the well-known mixup technique by incorporating a novel
approach that accounts for the periodic nature of non-stationary time-series.
Also, by controlling the degree of chaos created by data augmentation, our
method leads to improved feature representations and performance on downstream
tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on three time-series tasks, including
heart rate estimation, human activity recognition, and cardiovascular disease
detection. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods show that the
proposed approach outperforms prior works on optimal data generation and known
data augmentation techniques in the three tasks, reflecting the effectiveness

stochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in
multi-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has
the unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit
information, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of
hierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their
discriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs
a binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated
on 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and
rocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach
significantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a
third of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,

patient privacy and algorithmic fairness. For example, previous work has shown
that patient self-reported race can be predicted from medical data that does
not explicitly contain racial information. However, the extent of data
identification is unknown, and we lack ways to develop models whose outcomes
are minimally affected by such information. Here we systematically investigated
the ability of time-series electronic health record data to predict patient

a variety of static information with area under the receiver operating

engineering issues of conventional nonlinear prediction models and achieves an
efficient mix of nonlinear and linear components. In particular, we use
recursive structures to extract features from raw sequential sequences and a
traditional linear time series model to deal with the intricacies of the
sequential data, e.g., seasonality, trends. The state-of-the-art ensemble or
hybrid models typically train the base models in a disjoint manner, which is
not only time consuming but also sub-optimal due to the separation of modeling

congestion and rush hours can result in low correlation in vehicle speeds at

predict future series based on recent observations and entirely discard
training data during the testing phase, rendering them unreliable for
forecasting highly nonlinear multivariate time series. To tackle this issue, we
propose a test-time compensated representation learning framework comprising a

the temporal dimension according to periodicity characteristics, while the
latter component establishes a connection between recent observations and

state-of-the-art accuracy. Utilizing random 1-D convolutional kernels without
training, ROCKET and MINIROCKET can rapidly extract features from time series
data, allowing for the efficient fitting of linear classifiers. However, to
comprehensively capture useful features, a large number of random kernels are
required, which is incompatible for resource-constrained devices. Therefore, a
heuristic evolutionary algorithm named S-ROCKET is devised to recognize and
prune redundant kernels. Nevertheless, the inherent nature of evolutionary
algorithms renders the evaluation of kernels within S-ROCKET an unacceptable
time-consuming process. In this paper, diverging from S-ROCKET, which directly
evaluates random kernels with nonsignificant differences, we remove kernels
from a feature selection perspective by eliminating associating connections in
the sequential classification layer. To this end, we start by formulating the

pipelines. However, providing statistically meaningful uncertainty intervals
for prediction errors remains relatively under-explored. Practitioners often
resort to forward cross-validation (FCV) for obtaining point estimators and
constructing confidence intervals based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The
naive version assumes independence, a condition that is usually invalid due to
time correlation. These approaches lack statistical interpretations and
theoretical justifications even under stationarity.
  This paper systematically investigates uncertainty intervals for prediction
errors in time series forecasting. We first distinguish two key inferential
targets: the stochastic test error over near future data points, and the
expected test error as the expectation of the former. The stochastic test error
is often more relevant in applications needing to quantify uncertainty over
individual time series instances. To construct prediction intervals for the
stochastic test error, we propose the quantile-based forward cross-validation
(QFCV) method. Under an ergodicity assumption, QFCV intervals have
asymptotically valid coverage and are shorter than marginal empirical
quantiles. In addition, we also illustrate why naive CLT-based FCV intervals
fail to provide valid uncertainty intervals, even with certain corrections. For
non-stationary time series, we further provide rolling intervals by combining
QFCV with adaptive conformal prediction to give time-average coverage
guarantees. Overall, we advocate the use of QFCV procedures and demonstrate

time series models where the conditional expectation is modeled through a
parametric function. The proposed class of estimators is based on a Gaussian
quasi-likelihood function and it relies on the specification of a parametric
pseudo-variance that can contain parametric restrictions with respect to the
conditional expectation. The specification of the pseudo-variance and the
parametric restrictions follow naturally in observation-driven models with
bounds in the support of the observable process, such as count processes and
double-bounded time series. We derive the asymptotic properties of the
estimators and a validity test for the parameter restrictions. We show that the
results remain valid irrespective of the correct specification of the
pseudo-variance. The key advantage of the restricted estimators is that they
can achieve higher efficiency compared to alternative quasi-likelihood methods
that are available in the literature. Furthermore, the testing approach can be
used to build specification tests for parametric time series models. We
illustrate the practical use of the methodology in a simulation study and two
empirical applications featuring integer-valued autoregressive processes, where
assumptions on the dispersion of the thinning operator are formally tested, and
autoregressions for double-bounded data with application to a realized

impact of pre-training on the fine-tuning process. Currently, experimental
findings based on text and image data lack consensus. To delve deeper into the
unsupervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning paradigm, we have extended
previous research to a new modality: time series. In this study, we conducted a
thorough examination of 150 classification datasets derived from the Univariate
Time Series (UTS) and Multivariate Time Series (MTS) benchmarks. Our analysis
reveals several key conclusions. (i) Pre-training can only help improve the
optimization process for models that fit the data poorly, rather than those
that fit the data well. (ii) Pre-training does not exhibit the effect of
regularization when given sufficient training time. (iii) Pre-training can only
speed up convergence if the model has sufficient ability to fit the data. (iv)
Adding more pre-training data does not improve generalization, but it can
strengthen the advantage of pre-training on the original data volume, such as
faster convergence. (v) While both the pre-training task and the model

Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in enhancing
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge,
it remains unclear how effectively GANs can serve as a general-purpose solution
to learn representations for time series recognition, i.e., classification and

Convolutional GAN (TCGAN). TCGAN learns by playing an adversarial game between
two one-dimensional CNNs (i.e., a generator and a discriminator) in the absence
of label information. Parts of the trained TCGAN are then reused to construct a
representation encoder to empower linear recognition methods. We conducted
comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
demonstrate that TCGAN is faster and more accurate than existing time-series

for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for
applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that

decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable
""closeness-preserving"" matrix representation of the time-series, where each
column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to
compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis
that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of
DTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also

$p_1\times p_2$ matrix white noise series. Covariance matrix of the vectorized
white noises assumes a Kronecker structure such that the row and column
covariances of the noise all have diverging/spiked eigenvalues to accommodate
the case of low signal-to-noise ratio often encountered in applications, such

series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and
various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification
alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the

the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating
explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).
We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most

the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex
irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly,
most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not

instantaneous influence of new coming data and the long-term effects of
historical data. Specifically, DeLELSTM consists of two components, i.e.,
standard LSTM and tensorized LSTM. The tensorized LSTM assigns each variable

LSTM models all the variables with a shared hidden state $\mathbf{H}_t$. By
decomposing the $\mathbf{H}_t$ into the linear combination of past information
$\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$ and the fresh information $\mathbf{h}_{t}-\mathbf{h}_{t-1}$,
we can get the instantaneous influence and the long-term effect of each

simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the
time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural
network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align
the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical
studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD
makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching
similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time

assumption is that real-world time series is noisy and complementary
information from different views of the same time series plays an important
role while analyzing noisy input. Based on this, we create two views for the
input time series through two different encoders. We conduct co-training based
contrastive learning iteratively to learn the encoders. Our experiments
demonstrate that this co-training approach leads to a significant improvement
in performance. Especially, by leveraging the complementary information from
different views, our proposed TS-CoT method can mitigate the impact of data
noise and corruption. Empirical evaluations on four time series benchmarks in
unsupervised and semi-supervised settings reveal that TS-CoT outperforms
existing methods. Furthermore, the representations learned by TS-CoT can
transfer well to downstream tasks through fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12551v1,cs.LG

however, in a business sense, not all outliers are anomalies of interest.
Existing anomaly detection solutions are confined to certain outlier detectors
limiting their applicability to broader anomaly detection use cases. Network
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) tend to exhibit stochastic behaviour
producing statistical outliers, most of which do not adversely affect business
operations. Thus, a heuristic is required to capture the business definition of
an anomaly for time series KPI. This article proposes an Adaptive Thresholding
Heuristic (ATH) to dynamically adjust the detection threshold based on the
local properties of the data distribution and adapt to changes in time series
patterns. The heuristic derives the threshold based on the expected periodicity
and the observed proportion of anomalies minimizing false positives and
addressing concept drift. ATH can be used in conjunction with any underlying
seasonality decomposition method and an outlier detector that yields an outlier
score. This method has been tested on EON1-Cell-U, a labeled KPI anomaly
dataset produced by Ericsson, to validate our hypothesis. Experimental results
show that ATH is computationally efficient making it scalable for near real
time anomaly detection and flexible with multiple forecasters and outlier
detectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10504v1,cs.LG

spotlight and revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing. One of
the factors attributed to the effectiveness of LLMs is the model architecture
used for training, transformers. Transformer models excel at capturing
contextual features in sequential data since time series data are sequential,
transformer models can be leveraged for more efficient time series data
prediction. The field of prognostics is vital to system health management and
proper maintenance planning. A reliable estimation of the remaining useful life
(RUL) of machines holds the potential for substantial cost savings. This
includes avoiding abrupt machine failures, maximizing equipment usage, and
serving as a decision support system (DSS). This work proposed an
encoder-transformer architecture-based framework for multivariate time series
prediction for a prognostics use case. We validated the effectiveness of the
proposed framework on all four sets of the C-MAPPS benchmark dataset for the
remaining useful life prediction task. To effectively transfer the knowledge
and application of transformers from the natural language domain to time
series, three model-specific experiments were conducted. Also, to enable the
model awareness of the initial stages of the machine life and its degradation
path, a novel expanding window method was proposed for the first time in this
work, it was compared with the sliding window method, and it led to a large
improvement in the performance of the encoder transformer model. Finally, the
performance of the proposed encoder-transformer model was evaluated on the test

models in the literature and it outperformed them all with an average
performance increase of 137.65% over the next best model across all the

environmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespread
predictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality has
become increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the past
decades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machine

improve the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporating
watershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, and
incorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis here

analysis of time series data captures patterns such as trends, cyclicity and
irregularity, which are crucial for decision making in research, business, and
governance. However, missing values in time series data occur often and present
obstacles to successful analysis, thus they need to be filled with alternative
values, a process called imputation. Although various approaches have been
attempted for robust imputation of time series data, even the most advanced
methods still face challenges including limited scalability, poor capacity to
handle heterogeneous data types and inflexibility due to requiring strong
assumptions of data missing mechanisms. Moreover, the imputation accuracy of
these methods still has room for improvement. In this study, I developed
tsDataWig (time-series DataWig) by modifying DataWig, a neural network-based
method that possesses the capacity to process large datasets and heterogeneous
data types but was designed for non-time series data imputation. Unlike the
original DataWig, tsDataWig can directly handle values of time variables and
impute missing values in complex time series datasets. Using one simulated and
three different complex real-world time series datasets, I demonstrated that
tsDataWig outperforms the original DataWig and the current state-of-the-art
methods for time series data imputation and potentially has broad application
due to not requiring strong assumptions of data missing mechanisms. This study
provides a valuable solution for robustly imputing missing values in
challenging time series datasets, which often contain millions of samples, high

is fundamental to science and engineering. In computational neuroscience, the
prediction of future epileptic seizures from brain activity measurements, using
EEG data, remains largely unresolved despite much dedicated research effort.
Based on a longitudinal and state-of-the-art data set using intercranial EEG
measurements from people with epilepsy, we consider the automated discovery of
predictive features (or biomarkers) to forecast seizures in a patient-specific
way. To this end, we use the path signature, a recent development in the
analysis of data streams, to map from measured time series to seizure
prediction. The predictor is based on linear classification, here augmented
with sparsity constraints, to discern time series with and without an impending
seizure. This approach may be seen as a step towards a generic pattern
recognition pipeline where the main advantages are simplicity and ease of
customisation, while maintaining forecasting performance on par with modern
machine learning. Nevertheless, it turns out that although the path signature
method has some powerful theoretical guarantees, appropriate time series
statistics can achieve essentially the same results in our context of seizure
prediction. This suggests that, due to their inherent complexity and
non-stationarity, the brain's dynamics are not identifiable from the available
EEG measurement data, and, more concretely, epileptic episode prediction is not
reliably achieved using EEG measurement data alone.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09312v2,stat.ML

for Time Series Anomaly Detection (CARLA), an innovative end-to-end
self-supervised framework carefully developed to identify anomalous patterns in
both univariate and multivariate time series data. By taking advantage of
contrastive representation learning, We introduce an innovative end-to-end
self-supervised deep learning framework carefully developed to identify
anomalous patterns in both univariate and multivariate time series data. By
taking advantage of contrastive representation learning, CARLA effectively
generates robust representations for time series windows. It achieves this by
1) learning similar representations for temporally close windows and dissimilar
representations for windows and their equivalent anomalous windows and 2)
employing a self-supervised approach to classify normal/anomalous
representations of windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours in the
representation space. Most of the existing models focus on learning normal
behaviour. The normal boundary is often tightly defined, which can result in
slight deviations being classified as anomalies, resulting in a high false
positive rate and limited ability to generalise normal patterns. CARLA's
contrastive learning methodology promotes the production of highly consistent
and discriminative predictions, thereby empowering us to adeptly address the
inherent challenges associated with anomaly detection in time series data.
Through extensive experimentation on 7 standard real-world time series anomaly
detection benchmark datasets, CARLA demonstrates F1 and AU-PR superior to
existing state-of-the-art results. Our research highlights the immense

contemporaneous uncorrelation for stationary continuous-time processes to model
the different dependencies between the component series of multivariate time
series models. Several equivalent characterisations for the different

mixed graphs based on different definitions of causality and contemporaneous
uncorrelation, the (mixed) causality graph and the local (mixed) causality
graph, to visualise and to analyse the different dependencies in stationary
continuous-time processes. In these graphs, the components of the process are
represented by vertices, directed edges between the vertices indicate causal
influences and undirected edges indicate contemporaneous uncorrelation between
the component processes. Further, we introduce various notions of causal Markov
properties in analogy to Eichler (2012), which relate the different dependence
structures of subprocesses, and we derive sufficient criteria for the (local)
causality graph to satisfy them. Finally, as an example, the popular
multivariate continuous-time AR (MCAR) processes satisfy our assumptions. For
MCAR processes we show that the (local) causality graphs can be characterised

large-scale time-series data for building robust foundation models, our
approach LLM4TS focuses on leveraging the strengths of pre-trained LLMs. By
combining time-series patching with temporal encoding, we have enhanced the

supervised fine-tuning in chatbot domains, we prioritize a two-stage
fine-tuning process: first conducting supervised fine-tuning to orient the LLM
towards time-series data, followed by task-specific downstream fine-tuning.
Furthermore, to unlock the flexibility of pre-trained LLMs without extensive

the 1NN-DTW algorithm to the ROCKET family of classifiers. However, in the
current fast-paced development of new classifiers, taking a step back and
performing simple baseline checks is essential. These checks are often
overlooked, as researchers are focused on establishing new state-of-the-art
results, developing scalable algorithms, and making models explainable.
Nevertheless, there are many datasets that look like time series at first
glance, but classic algorithms such as tabular methods with no time ordering
may perform better on such problems. For example, for spectroscopy datasets,
tabular methods tend to significantly outperform recent time series methods. In
this study, we compare the performance of tabular models using classic machine
learning approaches (e.g., Ridge, LDA, RandomForest) with the ROCKET family of
classifiers (e.g., Rocket, MiniRocket, MultiRocket). Tabular models are simple
and very efficient, while the ROCKET family of classifiers are more complex and
have state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency among recent time series
classifiers. We find that tabular models outperform the ROCKET family of
classifiers on approximately 19% of univariate and 28% of multivariate datasets
in the UCR/UEA benchmark and achieve accuracy within 10 percentage points on
about 50% of datasets. Our results suggest that it is important to consider
simple tabular models as baselines when developing time series classifiers.
These models are very fast, can be as effective as more complex methods and may
be easier to understand and deploy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07886v1,cs.LG

significant amount of missing values. The dominant approach for classification
with such missing values is to impute them heuristically with specific values
(zero, mean, values of adjacent time-steps) or learnable parameters. However,
these simple strategies do not take the data generative process into account,
and more importantly, do not effectively capture the uncertainty in prediction
due to the multiple possibilities for the missing values. In this paper, we
propose a novel probabilistic framework for classification with multivariate
time series data with missing values. Our model consists of two parts; a deep
generative model for missing value imputation and a classifier. Extending the
existing deep generative models to better capture structures of time-series
data, our deep generative model part is trained to impute the missing values in
multiple plausible ways, effectively modeling the uncertainty of the
imputation. The classifier part takes the time series data along with the
imputed missing values and classifies signals, and is trained to capture the
predictive uncertainty due to the multiple possibilities of imputations.
Importantly, we show that na\""ively combining the generative model and the
classifier could result in trivial solutions where the generative model does
not produce meaningful imputations. To resolve this, we present a novel
regularization technique that can promote the model to produce useful
imputation values that help classification. Through extensive experiments on

Additionally, to reduce the computational complexity of the attention

rely on predicting outputs at a single point in time, we propose an attention
mask to allow computation only at the current time step. Together, each

and deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable performance in this
area. However, many real-world time series data exhibit significant periodic or
quasi-periodic dynamics that are often not adequately captured by existing deep
learning-based solutions. This results in an incomplete representation of the
underlying dynamic behaviors of interest. To address this gap, we propose an
unsupervised method called Floss that automatically regularizes learned
representations in the frequency domain. The Floss method first automatically
detects major periodicities from the time series. It then employs periodic
shift and spectral density similarity measures to learn meaningful
representations with periodic consistency. In addition, Floss can be easily
incorporated into both supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning
frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on common time series
classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of Floss. We incorporate Floss into several representative deep

hypothesize that the prior label distribution of the dataset is uniform.
However, we observe that the label distributions of training and test sets in
STR tasks are likely to be neither uniform nor identical. This distinct feature
calls for new approaches that estimate more reasonable distributions to train a
fair model. In this work, we propose Utopia Label Distribution Approximation
(ULDA) for time-series data, which makes the training label distribution closer
to real-world but unknown (utopia) label distribution. This would enhance the
model's fairness. Specifically, ULDA first convolves the training label
distribution by a Gaussian kernel. After convolution, the required sample
quantity at each regression label may change. We further devise the Time-slice
Normal Sampling (TNS) to generate new samples when the required sample quantity
is greater than the initial sample quantity, and the Convolutional Weighted
Loss (CWL) to lower the sample weight when the required sample quantity is less
than the initial quantity. These two modules not only assist the model training
on the approximated utopia label distribution, but also maintain the sample
continuity in temporal context space. To the best of our knowledge, ULDA is the
first method to address the label distribution bias in time-series data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULDA lifts the state-of-the-art
performance on two STR tasks and three benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07682v1,cs.LG

series and exhibit independence between time series. Extreme value theory has
not been considered previously for the unique features of longitudinal data.
Across time series the data are assumed to follow a common generalised Pareto
distribution, above a high threshold. To account for temporal dependence of

vision. By leveraging the inherent benefits of self-supervision, SSCL enables
the pre-training of representation models using vast amounts of unlabeled data.
Despite these advances, there remains a significant gap in understanding the
impact of different SSCL strategies on time series forecasting performance, as
well as the specific benefits that SSCL can bring. This paper aims to address
these gaps by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of
various training variables, including different SSCL algorithms, learning
strategies, model architectures, and their interplay. Additionally, to gain
deeper insights into the improvements brought about by SSCL in the context of
time-series forecasting, a qualitative analysis of the empirical receptive
field is performed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the end-to-end
training of a Transformer model using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and
SSCL emerges as the most effective approach in time series forecasting.

dependency between two-time series at different frequencies. However, real data
applications often exhibit nonlinear dependency in the frequency domain.
Conventional coherence analysis fails to capture such dependency. The quantile
coherence, on the other hand, characterizes nonlinear dependency by defining
the coherence at a set of quantile levels based on trigonometric quantile
regression. Although quantile coherence is a more powerful tool, its estimation
remains challenging due to the high level of noise. This paper introduces a new
estimation technique for quantile coherence. The proposed method is
semi-parametric, which uses the parametric form of the spectrum of the vector
autoregressive (VAR) model as an approximation to the quantile spectral matrix,
along with nonparametric smoothing across quantiles. For each fixed quantile
level, we obtain the VAR parameters from the quantile periodograms, then, using
the Durbin-Levinson algorithm, we calculate the preliminary estimate of
quantile coherence using the VAR parameters. Finally, we smooth the preliminary
estimate of quantile coherence across quantiles using a nonparametric smoother.
Numerical results show that the proposed estimation method outperforms
nonparametric methods. We show that quantile coherence-based bivariate time

applications, the identified clusters of financial stocks by quantile coherence

challenges involved in adapting Vision MLP-Mixer for time series and introduce
empirically validated components to enhance accuracy. This includes a novel
design paradigm of attaching online reconciliation heads to the MLP-Mixer

solar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into account
factors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper,
we put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal

time-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on
forecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). We also suggest a methodology
to extract a distribution for each time step prediction, which can serve as a
very valuable measure of uncertainty attached to the forecast. When evaluating
models, we propose a testing scheme in which we separate particularly difficult
examples from easy ones, in order to capture the model performances in crucial
situations, which in the case of this study are the days suffering from varying

taken from a device or a system simultaneously over time. There is an
increasing need to monitor multivariate time series and detect anomalies in
real time to ensure proper system operation and good service quality. It is
also highly desirable to have a lightweight anomaly detection system that
considers correlations between different variables, adapts to changes in the
pattern of the multivariate time series, offers immediate responses, and
provides supportive information regarding detection results based on
unsupervised learning and online model training. In the past decade, many
multivariate time series anomaly detection approaches have been introduced.
However, they are unable to offer all the above-mentioned features. In this
paper, we propose RoLA, a real-time online lightweight anomaly detection system
for multivariate time series based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, parallel
processing, and the majority rule. RoLA employs multiple lightweight anomaly
detectors to monitor multivariate time series in parallel, determine the
correlations between variables dynamically on the fly, and then jointly detect
anomalies based on the majority rule in real time. To demonstrate the
performance of RoLA, we conducted an experiment based on a public dataset
provided by the FerryBox of the One Ocean Expedition. The results show that
RoLA provides satisfactory detection accuracy and lightweight performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16509v1,cs.LG

multivariate time series, comprising of time series for a range of quantities.
In some applications such complex systems can be associated with some
underlying network describing pairwise relationships among the quantities.
Accounting for the underlying network structure for the analysis of this type
of multivariate time series is required for assessing estimation error and can
be particularly informative for forecasting. Our work is motivated by a dataset
consisting of time series of industry-to-industry transactions. In this
example, pairwise relationships between Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) codes can be represented using a network, with SIC codes as nodes and
pairwise transactions between SIC codes as edges, while the observed time
series of the amounts of the transactions for each pair of SIC codes can be
regarded as time-varying weights on the edges. Inspired by Knight et al.
(2020), we introduce the GNAR-edge model which allows modelling of multiple
time series utilising the network structure, assuming that each edge weight
depends not only on its past values, but also on past values of its
neighbouring edges, for a range of neighbourhood stages. The method is
validated through simulations. Results from the implementation of the GNAR-edge
model on the real industry-to-industry data show good fitting and predictive
performance of the model. The predictive performance is improved when
sparsifying the network using a lead-lag analysis and thresholding edges
according to a lead-lag score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16097v3,stat.ME

many domains, such as energy consumption and weather forecasting. With the
development of transformer-based methods, the performance of multivariate
long-term time series forecasting has been significantly improved, however, the
study of spatial features extracting in transformer-based model is rare and the
consistency of different prediction periods is unsatisfactory due to the large
span. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in
terms of feature extraction and target prediction. For extraction, we design an
efficient spatio-temporal encoding extractor including a semi-adaptive graph to
acquire sufficient spatio-temporal information. For prediction, we propose a
Cascaded Decoding Predictor (CDP) to strengthen the correlation between
different intervals, which can also be utilized as a generic component to
improve the performance of transformer-based methods. The proposed method,
termed as Spatio-temporal Encoding Cascaded Transformer (Stecformer), achieving
a notable gap over the baseline model and is comparable with the
state-of-the-art performance of transformer-based methods on five benchmark

as meteorology, traffic surveillance, investment, and energy production and

developed to tackle this problem. However, these approaches either lack
explainability or exhibit less satisfactory performance when the prediction
horizon increases. To this end, we propose a novel plan for the designing of
networks' architecture based on transformations, possessing the potential to
achieve an enhanced receptive field in learning which brings benefits to fuse
features across scales. In this context, we introduce four different
transformation mechanisms as bases to construct the learning model including
Fourier Transform (FT), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), matrix
multiplication and Conv block. Hence, we develop four learning models based on
the above building blocks, namely, FT-Matrix, FT-SVD, FT-Conv, and Conv-SVD.
Note that the FT and SVD blocks are capable of learning global information,
while the Conv blocks focus on learning local information. The matrix block is
sparsely designed to learn both global and local information simultaneously.
The above Transformation Learning Networks (TLNets) have been extensively

distributed on a matrix-shaped spatial grid, using the historical
spatio-temporal data together with auxiliary vector-valued time series data. We
model the matrix time series as an auto-regressive process, where a future
matrix is jointly predicted by the historical values of the matrix time series
as well as an auxiliary vector time series. The matrix predictors are
associated with row/column-specific autoregressive matrix coefficients that map
the predictors to the future matrices via a bi-linear transformation. The
vector predictors are mapped to matrices by taking mode product with a 3D
coefficient tensor. Given the high dimensionality of the tensor coefficient and
the underlying spatial structure of the data, we propose to estimate the tensor
coefficient by estimating one functional coefficient for each covariate, with
2D input domain, from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We jointly estimate
the autoregressive matrix coefficients and the functional coefficients under a
penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework, and couple it with an
alternating minimization algorithm. Large sample asymptotics of the estimators
are established and performances of the model are validated with extensive
simulation studies and a real data application to forecast the global total

more widely researched nowadays. However, due to the unintuitive nature of
time-series data, the interpretability problem -- where we understand what is

also shed light on how to explain time-series models. In this paper, we present
a wide range of post-hoc interpretation methods for time-series models based on
backpropagation, perturbation, and approximation. We also want to bring focus
onto inherently interpretable models, a novel category of interpretation where
human-understandable information is designed within the models. Furthermore, we
introduce some common evaluation metrics used for the explanations, and propose
several directions of future researches on the time-series interpretability

explainable way to use neural networks by constructing a factor model and
incorporating deep neural networks within the kernel function. Additionally, we

time series, in the presence of potential confounders. A hypothesis test is
introduced for identifying the temporally causal influence of $(x_n)$ on
$(y_n)$, causally conditioned on a possibly confounding third time series
$(z_n)$. Under natural Markovian modeling assumptions, it is shown that the
null hypothesis, corresponding to the absence of temporally causal influence,
is equivalent to the underlying `causal conditional directed information rate'
being equal to zero. The plug-in estimator for this functional is identified
with the log-likelihood ratio test statistic for the desired test. This
statistic is shown that is asymptotically normal under the alternative
hypothesis and asymptotically $\chi^2$ distributed under the null, facilitating
the computation of $p$-values when used on empirical data. The effectiveness of
the resulting hypothesis test is illustrated on simulated data, validating the
underlying theory. The test is also employed in the analysis of spike train
data recorded from neurons in the V4 and FEF brain regions of behaving animals

task for numerous real-world applications such as healthcare, astronomy, and
climate sciences. State-of-the-art approaches to this problem rely on Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) which are known to be slow and often require
additional features to handle missing values. To address this issue, we propose
a novel model using Graphs for Forecasting Irregularly Sampled Time Series with
missing values which we call GraFITi. GraFITi first converts the time series to
a Sparsity Structure Graph which is a sparse bipartite graph, and then
reformulates the forecasting problem as the edge weight prediction task in the
graph. It uses the power of Graph Neural Networks to learn the graph and
predict the target edge weights. GraFITi has been tested on 3 real-world and 1
synthetic irregularly sampled time series dataset with missing values and
compared with various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results

Controlling for the effect of these variables is useful when modeling or

series data conditional on a set of covariates. We do this by modeling the
conditional mean and the conditional variance of the time series with
generalized additive models using a set of covariates. The conditional mean and
variance are then used to normalize the time series. We illustrate the use of
conditionally normalized series using two applications involving river network
data. First, we show how these normalized time series can be used to impute
missing values in the data. Second, we show how the normalized series can be
used to estimate the conditional autocorrelation function and conditional
cross-correlation functions via additive models. Finally we use the conditional

networks (GANs) remains a challenging task, as it is difficult to capture the
temporal dependence of joint probability distributions induced by time-series

discriminator to distinguish between time series distributions. We propose the
so-called PCF-GAN, a novel GAN that incorporates the path characteristic
function (PCF) as the principled representation of time series distribution
into the discriminator to enhance its generative performance. On the one hand,
we establish theoretical foundations of the PCF distance by proving its
characteristicity, boundedness, differentiability with respect to generator
parameters, and weak continuity, which ensure the stability and feasibility of
training the PCF-GAN. On the other hand, we design efficient initialisation and
optimisation schemes for PCFs to strengthen the discriminative power and
accelerate training efficiency. To further boost the capabilities of complex
time series generation, we integrate the auto-encoder structure via sequential
embedding into the PCF-GAN, which provides additional reconstruction
functionality. Extensive numerical experiments on various datasets demonstrate
the consistently superior performance of PCF-GAN over state-of-the-art

Transformer, i.e., channel-aligned robust dual Transformer (CARD for short),
that addresses key shortcomings of Transformer in time series forecasting.
First, CARD introduces a dual Transformer structure that allows it to capture
both temporal correlations among signals and dynamical dependence among
multiple variables over time. Second, we introduce a robust loss function for
time series forecasting to alleviate the potential overfitting issue. This new
loss function weights the importance of forecasting over a finite horizon based

methods: generative models, probabilistic, and simulator-based approaches. The
framework enables users to evaluate the quality of the produced data from
different angles: similarity, downstream effectiveness, predictive consistency,
diversity, and privacy. The framework is extensible, which allows researchers
to rapidly implement their own methods and compare them in a shareable

solve the problem by computing a CUSUM tensor based on spectra estimated from

applied to the CUSUM tensor for dimension reduction. The projection direction
is estimated by a proposed sparse tensor decomposition algorithm. Finally, the
projected CUSUM vectors across frequencies are aggregated by a sparsified wild

two main challenges: (i) the complex data structure, such as temporal
dependency, can result in violation of the independent assumption; (ii) the
factors from different views are generally overlapped and are hard to be
aggregated to a complete set. In this work, we propose a novel framework MuLTI
that employs the contrastive learning technique to invert the data generative
process for enhanced identifiability. Additionally, MuLTI integrates a
permutation mechanism that merges corresponding overlapped variables by the
establishment of an optimal transport formula. Extensive experimental results

is admitted again for the same or related care within a certain period.
Hospital readmissions are a significant problem in the healthcare domain, as
they lead to increased hospitalization costs, decreased patient satisfaction,
and increased risk of adverse outcomes such as infections, medication errors,
and even death. The problem of hospital readmissions is particularly acute in
intensive care units (ICUs), due to the severity of the patients' conditions,
and the substantial risk of complications. Predicting Unplanned Readmissions in
ICUs is a challenging task, as it involves analyzing different data modalities,
such as static data, unstructured free text, sequences of diagnoses and
procedures, and multivariate time-series. Here, we investigate the
effectiveness of each data modality separately, then alongside with others,
using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in time-series analysis and
natural language processing. Using our evaluation process, we are able to
determine the contribution of each data modality, and for the first time in the
context of readmission, establish a hierarchy of their predictive value.
Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of Temporal Abstractions in enhancing
the performance of time-series approaches to readmission prediction. Due to
conflicting definitions in the literature, we also provide a clear definition
of the term Unplanned Readmission to enhance reproducibility and consistency of
future research and to prevent any potential misunderstandings that could
result from diverse interpretations of the term. Our experimental results on a

detect change points in the marginal distribution, but also those in possibly
non-linear serial dependence, all without the need to pre-specify the type of
changes. We show the theoretical consistency of NP-MOJO in estimating the total

neural networks or graph neural networks have been developed to exploit the
complex temporal and spatial dependencies present in the time series. While
these solutions have shown significant advantages over statistical approaches,
one open question is to effectively incorporate the global information which
represents the seasonality patterns via the time component of time series into
the forecasting models to improve their accuracy. This paper presents a general
approach to integrating the time component into forecasting models. The main
idea is to employ conditional neural fields to represent the auxiliary features

promising results in analyzing irregularly sampled time series frequently

are typically processed with a hybrid of an initial value problem (IVP) solver

Sequentially solving IVPs makes such models computationally less efficient. In
this paper, we propose to model time series purely with continuous processes
whose state evolution can be approximated directly by IVPs. This eliminates the
need for recurrent computation and enables multiple states to evolve in
parallel. We further fuse the encoder and decoder with one IVP solver utilizing
its invertibility, which leads to fewer parameters and faster convergence.

discovering lead-lag relationships inherent in the data, which refer to the
dependence between two time series shifted in time relative to one another, and
which can be leveraged for the purposes of control, forecasting or clustering.
We develop a clustering-driven methodology for robust detection of lead-lag
relationships in lagged multi-factor models. Within our framework, the
envisioned pipeline takes as input a set of time series, and creates an
enlarged universe of extracted subsequence time series from each input time
series, via a sliding window approach. This is then followed by an application
of various clustering techniques, (such as k-means++ and spectral clustering),
employing a variety of pairwise similarity measures, including nonlinear ones.
Once the clusters have been extracted, lead-lag estimates across clusters are
robustly aggregated to enhance the identification of the consistent
relationships in the original universe. We establish connections to the
multireference alignment problem for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous

of incoherent base forecasts into coherent forecasts in line with given data
structures. Most of the point and probabilistic regression-based forecast
reconciliation results ground on the so called ""structural representation"" and
on the related unconstrained generalized least squares reconciliation formula.
However, the structural representation naturally applies to genuine
hierarchical/grouped time series, where the top- and bottom-level variables are
uniquely identified. When a general linearly constrained multiple time series
is considered, the forecast reconciliation is naturally expressed according to
a projection approach. While it is well known that the classic structural
reconciliation formula is equivalent to its projection approach counterpart, so
far it is not completely understood if and how a structural-like reconciliation
formula may be derived for a general linearly constrained multiple time series.
Such an expression would permit to extend reconciliation definitions, theorems
and results in a straightforward manner. In this paper, we show that for
general linearly constrained multiple time series it is possible to express the
reconciliation formula according to a ""structural-like"" approach that keeps
distinct free and constrained, instead of bottom and upper (aggregated),

many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of
subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of
causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been
proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve
identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that
can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without
any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling
arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile,
every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at
some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure.
Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the
hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition,
we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is
nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification. Theoretical

research has primarily focused on either CI or CD in isolation, and the
challenge of effectively combining these two opposing properties to achieve a
synergistic effect remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we carefully

that has not been effectively answered, e.g.,""How to effectively mix the CI and
CD properties of time series to achieve better predictive performance?"" To
answer this question, we propose Mlinear (MIX-Linear), a simple yet effective

Self-supervised Transformers have shown outstanding performance in a variety of

layers can also significantly limit the input sequence length without
appropriate input engineering. We introduce the DuETT architecture, an
extension of Transformers designed to attend over both time and event type
dimensions, yielding robust representations from EHR data. DuETT uses an
aggregated input where sparse time series are transformed into a regular

time-series as stochastic or non-stochastic, to understand the underlying
physical process. Content-aware conversion of 1D time-series to 2D
representation, that simultaneously utilizes time- and frequency-domain
characteristics, is proposed. An autoencoder is trained with a loss function to
learn latent space (using both time- and frequency domains) representation,
that is designed to be, time-invariant. Every element of the time-series is
represented as a tuple with two components, one each, from latent space
representation in time- and frequency-domains, forming a binary image. In this
binary image, those tuples that represent the points in the time-series,
together form the ``Latent Space Signature"" (LSS) of the input time-series. The
obtained binary LSS images are fed to a classification network. The
EfficientNetv2-S classifier is trained using 421 synthetic time-series, with
fair representation from both categories. The proposed methodology is evaluated
on publicly available astronomical data which are 12 distinct temporal classes
of time-series pertaining to the black hole GRS 1915 + 105, obtained from RXTE

enjoys the simplicity and speed of linear models while also being able to
handle covariates and non-linear dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that the
simplest linear analogue of our model can achieve near optimal error rate for
linear dynamical systems (LDS) under some assumptions. Empirically, we show
that our method can match or outperform prior approaches on popular long-term

real-world applications. Due to label sparsity, training a deep anomaly
detector often relies on unsupervised approaches. Recent efforts have been
devoted to time series domain adaptation to leverage knowledge from similar
domains. However, existing solutions may suffer from negative knowledge
transfer on anomalies due to their diversity and sparsity. Motivated by the
empirical study of context alignment between two domains, we aim to transfer
knowledge between two domains via adaptively sampling context information for
two domains. This is challenging because it requires simultaneously modeling
the complex in-domain temporal dependencies and cross-domain correlations while
exploiting label information from the source domain. To this end, we propose a
framework that combines context sampling and anomaly detection into a joint
learning procedure. We formulate context sampling into the Markov decision
process and exploit deep reinforcement learning to optimize the time series
domain adaptation process via context sampling and design a tailored reward
function to generate domain-invariant features that better align two domains
for anomaly detection. Experiments on three public datasets show promise for
knowledge transfer between two similar domains and two entirely different

conventional CUSUM theory derived for a single functional time series. In
particular, the extra power enhancement component enlarges the region where the
proposed test has power, and results in stable power performance when breaks
are sparse in the alternative hypothesis. Furthermore, we impose a latent group
structure on the subjects with heterogeneous break points and introduce an
easy-to-implement clustering algorithm with an information criterion to
consistently estimate the unknown group number and membership. The estimated
group structure can subsequently improve the convergence property of the

is expected to be collected and processed in real time, the ability to handle
time series data has become increasingly significant. To help analyze time
series in data mining applications, many time series representation approaches
have been proposed to convert a raw time series into another series for
representing the original time series. However, existing approaches are not
designed for open-ended time series (which is a sequence of data points being
continuously collected at a fixed interval without any length limit) because
these approaches need to know the total length of the target time series in
advance and pre-process the entire time series using normalization methods.
Furthermore, many representation approaches require users to configure and tune
some parameters beforehand in order to achieve satisfactory representation
results. In this paper, we propose NP-Free, a real-time Normalization-free and
Parameter-tuning-free representation approach for open-ended time series.
Without needing to use any normalization method or tune any parameter, NP-Free
can generate a representation for a raw time series on the fly by converting
each data point of the time series into a root-mean-square error (RMSE) value
based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Look-Back and Predict-Forward
strategy. To demonstrate the capability of NP-Free in representing time series,
we conducted several experiments based on real-world open-source time series
datasets. We also evaluated the time consumption of NP-Free in generating
representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06168v1,cs.LG

of types of feature that may be relevant for different classification tasks,
including trends, variance, frequency, magnitude, and various patterns. To
address this challenge, several alternative classes of approach have been
developed, including similarity-based, features and intervals, shapelets,
dictionary, kernel, neural network, and hybrid approaches. While kernel, neural
network, and hybrid approaches perform well overall, some specialized
approaches are better suited for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose a
new similarity-based classifier, Proximity Forest version 2.0 (PF 2.0), which
outperforms previous state-of-the-art similarity-based classifiers across the
UCR benchmark and outperforms state-of-the-art kernel, neural network, and
hybrid methods on specific datasets in the benchmark that are best addressed by
similarity-base methods. PF 2.0 incorporates three recent advances in time
series similarity measures -- (1) computationally efficient early abandoning
and pruning to speedup elastic similarity computations; (2) a new elastic
similarity measure, Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW); and (3) cost function
tuning. It rationalizes the set of similarity measures employed, reducing the
eight base measures of the original PF to three and using the first derivative

multivariate forecasting models need to capture the relationship between the
channels to accurately predict future values. However, recently, there has been
an emergence of methods that employ the Channel Independent (CI) strategy.
These methods view multivariate time series data as separate univariate time
series and disregard the correlation between channels. Surprisingly, our
empirical results have shown that models trained with the CI strategy
outperform those trained with the Channel Dependent (CD) strategy, usually by a
significant margin. Nevertheless, the reasons behind this phenomenon have not
yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper provides
comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses of the characteristics of
multivariate time series datasets and the CI/CD strategy. Our results conclude
that the CD approach has higher capacity but often lacks robustness to
accurately predict distributionally drifted time series. In contrast, the CI
approach trades capacity for robust prediction. Practical measures inspired by
these analyses are proposed to address the capacity and robustness dilemma,
including a modified CD method called Predict Residuals with Regularization
(PRReg) that can surpass the CI strategy. We hope our findings can raise

task, which can be effectively solved by popular deep learning technology.
Unfortunately, the existing deep learning-based methods neglect the hidden

capability to obtain satisfactory classification accuracy. To address this
problem, we propose a novel temporal dynamic graph neural network (TodyNet)
that can extract hidden spatio-temporal dependencies without undefined graph
structure. It enables information flow among isolated but implicit
interdependent variables and captures the associations between different time
slots by dynamic graph mechanism, which further improves the classification
performance of the model. Meanwhile, the hierarchical representations of graphs
cannot be learned due to the limitation of GNNs. Thus, we also design a
temporal graph pooling layer to obtain a global graph-level representation for
graph learning with learnable temporal parameters. The dynamic graph, graph
information propagation, and temporal convolution are jointly learned in an
end-to-end framework. The experiments on 26 UEA benchmark datasets illustrate

these characteristics, the Transformer has recently been exploited for time
series forecasting problems, assuming a natural adaptability to the domain of
continuous numerical series. Despite the acclaimed results in the literature,
some works have raised doubts about the robustness and effectiveness of this

applications. However, the low spatial resolution of EEG presents challenges in
decoding low-channel motor imagery. This study introduces TSFF-Net, a novel

Time-frequency representation and feature extraction transform raw EEG signals
into time-frequency spectrograms and extract relevant features. The time-space
network processes time-series EEG trials as input and extracts temporal-spatial
features. Feature fusion employs MMD loss to constrain the distribution of
time-frequency and time-space features in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space,
subsequently combining these features using a weighted fusion approach to
obtain effective time-space-frequency features. Moreover, few studies have

spectrograms. This study proposes a shallow, lightweight decoding architecture
(TSFF-img) based on time-frequency spectrograms and compares its classification
performance in low-channel motor imagery with other methods using two publicly

compensates for the shortcomings of single-mode feature extraction networks in

problems. Traditional entropy measures, such as Shannon entropy, use
probability distribution function. However, for the effective separation of
time series, new entropy estimation methods are required to characterize the
chaotic dynamic of the system. Our concept of Neural Network Entropy (NNetEn)
is based on the classification of special datasets in relation to the entropy
of the time series recorded in the reservoir of the neural network. NNetEn
estimates the chaotic dynamics of time series in an original way and does not
take into account probability distribution functions. We propose two new
classification metrics: R2 Efficiency and Pearson Efficiency. The efficiency of
NNetEn is verified on separation of two chaotic time series of sine mapping
using dispersion analysis. For two close dynamic time series (r = 1.1918 and r
= 1.2243), the F-ratio has reached the value of 124 and reflects high
efficiency of the introduced method in classification problems. The
electroenceph-alography signal classification for healthy persons and patients

detecting the causal relationship between two time series while accounting for
these measurement impairments. In this context, we first formulate the problem
of Granger causality detection as a binary hypothesis test using the norm of
the estimates of the vector auto-regressive~(VAR) coefficients of the two time

classification problems has grown considerably over the past decades, including
the development of sophisticated but challenging-to-interpret
deep-learning-based methods. But without comparison to simpler methods it can
be difficult to determine when such complexity is required to obtain strong
performance on a given problem. Here we evaluate the performance of an
extremely simple classification approach -- a linear classifier in the space of
two simple features that ignore the sequential ordering of the data: the mean
and standard deviation of time-series values. Across a large repository of 128
univariate time-series classification problems, this simple distributional
moment-based approach outperformed chance on 69 problems, and reached 100%
accuracy on two problems. With a neuroimaging time-series case study, we find
that a simple linear model based on the mean and standard deviation performs
better at classifying individuals with schizophrenia than a model that
additionally includes features of the time-series dynamics. Comparing the
performance of simple distributional features of a time series provides
important context for interpreting the performance of complex time-series

the conventional SSA-based method which measures the minimum angle between the
two signal subspaces as the degree of changes. By replacing the minimum angle

is to create public data from private data in a manner that preserves the

completely nonparametric as the dissimilarities between stationary

processes exhibit characteristics in both the time and frequency domains, we
propose to combine Spectral and Time Augmentation (STAug) for generating more

Empirical Mode Decomposition to decompose a time series and reassemble the
subcomponents with random weights. This way, we generate diverse samples while

normal examples in order to fool a well-trained deep learning model to
misclassify. In the context of computer vision, this notion of
indistinguishability is typically bounded by $L_{\infty}$ or other norms.
However, these norms are not appropriate for measuring indistinguishiability
for time series data. In this work, we propose adversarial examples in the
Wasserstein space for time series data for the first time and utilize
Wasserstein distance to bound the perturbation between normal examples and
adversarial examples. We introduce Wasserstein projected gradient descent
(WPGD), an adversarial attack method for perturbing univariant time series
data. We leverage the closed-form solution of Wasserstein distance in the 1D
space to calculate the projection step of WPGD efficiently with the gradient
descent method. We further propose a two-step projection so that the search of
adversarial examples in the Wasserstein space is guided and constrained by
Euclidean norms to yield more effective and imperceptible perturbations. We
empirically evaluate the proposed attack on several time series datasets in the
healthcare domain. Extensive results demonstrate that the Wasserstein attack is
powerful and can successfully attack most of the target classifiers with a high
attack success rate. To better study the nature of Wasserstein adversarial
example, we evaluate a strong defense mechanism named Wasserstein smoothing for
potential certified robustness defense. Although the defense can achieve some

encoder can be trained to learn robust and discriminative representations.
Unlike image and language domains where ``desired'' augmented samples can be
generated with the rule of thumb guided by prefabricated human priors, the
ad-hoc manual selection of time series augmentations is hindered by their

surroundings, such as EEG data to examine alterations in brain activity or
sensors to monitor body movements. Segmentation of multivariate time series
data is a technique for identifying meaningful patterns or changes in the time
series that can signal a shift in the system's behavior. However, most
segmentation algorithms have been designed primarily for univariate time
series, and their performance on multivariate data remains largely
unsatisfactory, making this a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for multivariate time series segmentation using conditional
independence (CI) graphs. CI graphs are probabilistic graphical models that
represents the partial correlations between the nodes. We propose a domain
agnostic multivariate segmentation framework `$\texttt{tGLAD}$' which draws a
parallel between the CI graph nodes and the variables of the time series.
Consider applying a graph recovery model $\texttt{uGLAD}$ to a short interval
of the time series, it will result in a CI graph that shows partial
correlations among the variables. We extend this idea to the entire time series
by utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run
a single $\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the
CI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI
graphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based
trajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across
distinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a
suitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides

interesting byproduct of this formulation is that DecDTW outputs the optimal
warping path between two time series as opposed to a soft approximation,
recoverable from Soft-DTW. We show that this property is particularly useful
for applications where downstream loss functions are defined on the optimal
alignment path itself. This naturally occurs, for instance, when learning to

deep learning layers for efficient sequence modeling. However, we find
fundamental limitations with these prior approaches, proving their SSM
representations cannot express autoregressive time series processes. We thus
introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves
all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization
based on the companion matrix -- a canonical representation for discrete-time
processes -- which enables SpaceTime's SSM layers to learn desirable
autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a

predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For
efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the

As the world is generally too complex to be modelled exactly, it is often
meaningful to assess the probability of a dynamical system to be in a specific
state. This paper presents the Delay-SDE-net, a neural network model based on
stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs). The use of SDDEs with multiple
delays as modelling framework makes it a suitable model for time series with
memory effects, as it includes memory through previous states of the system.
The stochastic part of the Delay-SDE-net provides a basis for estimating
uncertainty in modelling, and is split into two neural networks to account for
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The uncertainty is provided instantly,
making the model suitable for applications where time is sparse. We derive the
theoretical error of the Delay-SDE-net and analyze the convergence rate
numerically. At comparisons with similar models, the Delay-SDE-net has
consistently the best performance, both in predicting time series values and
uncertainties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08587v1,cs.LG

referred to as a data leak. In this work, a novel Moving Front (MF) method is
proposed to prevent data leakage, so that the decomposed series can be treated

namely the normal states. Based on our findings, we propose a reweighting
framework that down-weights the losses incurred by abrupt changes and
up-weights those by normal states. For the reweighting framework, we first
define a measurement termed Local Discrepancy (LD) which measures the degree of
abruptness of a change in a given period of time. Since a training set is
mostly composed of normal states, we then consider how frequently the temporal
changes appear in the training set based on LD. Our reweighting framework is
applicable to existing time-series forecasting models regardless of the
architectures. Through extensive experiments on 12 time-series forecasting
models over eight datasets with various in-output sequence lengths, we
demonstrate that applying our reweighting framework reduces MSE by 10.1% on
average and by up to 18.6% in the state-of-the-art model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13563v2,cs.LG

Reddy', 'Vignesh Subbian']","Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for
clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data
often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing
missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and
noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we
present a Self-supervised Learning-based Approach to Clustering multivariate
Time-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a
Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a
proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series
representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and
the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters
the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the
subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters.
To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the Transforming Research and Clinical
Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study. Our experiments
demonstrate that SLAC-Time outperforms the baseline K-means clustering
algorithm in terms of silhouette coefficient, Calinski Harabasz index, Dunn
index, and Davies Bouldin index. We identified three TBI phenotypes that are
distinct from one another in terms of clinically significant variables as well
as clinical outcomes, including the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE)
score, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate. The
experiments show that the TBI phenotypes identified by SLAC-Time can be
potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic
strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13457v2,cs.LG

time series data are being produced. Accurate classification of such time
series facilitates decision making in multiple domains. State-of-the-art
classification accuracy is often achieved by ensemble learning where results
are synthesized from multiple base models. This characteristic implies that
ensemble learning needs substantial computing resources, preventing their use
in resource-limited environments, such as in edge devices. To extend the
applicability of ensemble learning, we propose the LightTS framework that
compresses large ensembles into lightweight models while ensuring competitive
accuracy. First, we propose adaptive ensemble distillation that assigns
adaptive weights to different base models such that their varying
classification capabilities contribute purposefully to the training of the
lightweight model. Second, we propose means of identifying Pareto optimal
settings w.r.t. model accuracy and model size, thus enabling users with a space
budget to select the most accurate lightweight model. We report on experiments

two major challenges remain outstanding: i) discovery of predictive patterns
from many potential temporal correlations in the multi-variate time-series data
and ii) association of individual temporal patterns to the target label
distribution that best characterizes the underlying clinical progression. To
address such challenges, we develop a novel temporal clustering method,
T-Phenotype, to discover phenotypes of predictive temporal patterns from
labeled time-series data. We introduce an efficient representation learning
approach in frequency domain that can encode variable-length,
irregularly-sampled time-series into a unified representation space, which is
then applied to identify various temporal patterns that potentially contribute
to the target label using a new notion of path-based similarity. Throughout the
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that T-Phenotype

distance covariance for object-valued time series. Furthermore, we propose a
generalized spectral density function to account for pairwise dependence at all

language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), limited progress has been
made for general time series analysis. Unlike NLP and CV where a unified model
can be used to perform different tasks, specially designed approach still
dominates in each time series analysis task such as classification, anomaly
detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The main challenge that blocks
the development of pre-trained model for time series analysis is the lack of a
large amount of data for training. In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging language or CV models, pre-trained from billions of tokens, for time
series analysis. Specifically, we refrain from altering the self-attention and
feedforward layers of the residual blocks in the pre-trained language or image
model. This model, known as the Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), is
evaluated through fine-tuning on all major types of tasks involving time
series. Our results demonstrate that pre-trained models on natural language or
images can lead to a comparable or state-of-the-art performance in all main
time series analysis tasks, as illustrated in Figure 1. We also found both
theoretically and empirically that the self-attention module behaviors
similarly to principle component analysis (PCA), an observation that helps
explains how transformer bridges the domain gap and a crucial step towards

distribution changes over time, largely hinders the performance of TSF models.
Existing works towards distribution shift in time series are mostly limited in
the quantification of distribution and, more importantly, overlook the
potential shift between lookback and horizon windows. To address above
challenges, we systematically summarize the distribution shift in TSF into two
categories. Regarding lookback windows as input-space and horizon windows as
output-space, there exist (i) intra-space shift, that the distribution within
the input-space keeps shifted over time, and (ii) inter-space shift, that the
distribution is shifted between input-space and output-space. Then we
introduce, Dish-TS, a general neural paradigm for alleviating distribution
shift in TSF. Specifically, for better distribution estimation, we propose the
coefficient net (CONET), which can be any neural architectures, to map input
sequences into learnable distribution coefficients. To relieve intra-space and
inter-space shift, we organize Dish-TS as a Dual-CONET framework to separately
learn the distribution of input- and output-space, which naturally captures the
distribution difference of two spaces. In addition, we introduce a more
effective training strategy for intractable CONET learning. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on several datasets coupled with different
state-of-the-art forecasting models. Experimental results show Dish-TS
consistently boosts them with a more than 20% average improvement. Code is

typically involves (pre-)training models on collected, historical data and then
applying them to unseen data points. However, in real-world applications, time
series data streams are usually non-stationary and trained ML models usually,
over time, face the problem of data or concept drift.
  To address this issue, models must be periodically retrained or redesigned,
which takes significant human and computational resources. Additionally,
historical data may not even exist to re-train or re-design model with. As a
result, it is highly desirable that models are designed and trained in an
online fashion. This work presents the Online NeuroEvolution-based Neural

Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence

potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would
incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant

these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for
improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed
FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform
multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further
designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a
well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed.
To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning
hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting

augmentation methods mainly apply to time series classification and anomaly
detection tasks. In time series forecasting (TSF), we need to model the
fine-grained temporal relationship within time series segments to generate
accurate forecasting results given data in a look-back window. Existing DA
solutions in the time domain would break such a relationship, leading to poor
forecasting accuracy. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes simple yet
effective frequency domain augmentation techniques that ensure the semantic
consistency of augmented data-label pairs in forecasting, named FrAug. We

similar performance to the ones trained on full training data, which is
particularly attractive for cold-start forecasting. Finally, we show that
applying test-time training with FrAug greatly improves forecasting accuracy

series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard
univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage
of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global)
inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated
with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data
efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global
model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a
different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper
is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based
spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological
framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in
such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of
amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow
for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers
with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model
to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights
and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time
series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate
predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04071v1,cs.LG

healthcare, where measurements are collected over time at uneven intervals.
However, for many classification problems, only small portions of long time
series are often relevant to the class label. In this case, existing ITS models
often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which
easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then
propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking
highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by
integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant
moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A
Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their
timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model
models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a
representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real

this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that impair the quality of
time series representation learned through contrastive learning ($i.e.$, noisy
positive pair and faulty positive pair). We show that, with the presence of
noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise
(Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model
spends considerable efforts aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty
Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining
(DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs
in time series contrastive learning. DBPM utilizes a memory module to track the
training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us
to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their

observational data, holds the potential to play a significant role in
extracting actionable insights about human health. In this study, we present a
novel constraint-based causal discovery approach for autocorrelated and
non-stationary time series data (CDANs). Our proposed method addresses several
limitations of existing causal discovery methods for autocorrelated and
non-stationary time series data, such as high dimensionality, the inability to
identify lagged causal relationships, and overlooking changing modules. Our
approach identifies lagged and instantaneous/contemporaneous causal
relationships along with changing modules that vary over time. The method
optimizes the conditioning sets in a constraint-based search by considering
lagged parents instead of conditioning on the entire past that addresses high
dimensionality. The changing modules are detected by considering both
contemporaneous and lagged parents. The approach first detects the lagged
adjacencies, then identifies the changing modules and contemporaneous
adjacencies, and finally determines the causal direction. We extensively
evaluated our proposed method on synthetic and real-world clinical datasets,

addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain.
Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable
problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal
domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label
shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them
across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of
private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying
label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13

deviations from the temporal patterns from majority of historical observations.
In multivariate time series, anomalies also refer to abnormal changes in the

networks. However, most works settle on learning a static graph globally or
within a context window to assist a time series forecasting task or a
reconstruction task, whose objective is not tailored to explicitly detect the
abnormal relationship. Some other works detect anomalies based on
reconstructing or forecasting a list of inter-series graphs, which
inadvertently weakens their power to capture temporal patterns within the data

multivariate time series anomaly detection framework based upon a list of

deviation of inter-series relationships and intra-series temporal patterns from
normal to anomalous states, by leveraging the evolving nature of the graphs in

attracted immense interest. One mainstream paradigm is masked modeling, which
successfully pre-trains deep models by learning to reconstruct the masked

randomly masking a portion of time points will seriously ruin vital temporal
variations of time series, making the reconstruction task too difficult to

information can then be used to predict the timing or probability of an
imminent failure in order to provide an early warning. In this study, a more
objective, statistical-learning algorithm is proposed to detect and
characterise the risk of a slope failure, based on spectral analysis of
serially correlated displacement time series data. The algorithm is applied to
satellite-based interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) displacement time
series data to retrospectively analyse the risk of the 2019 Brumadinho tailings

risk of failure is detected as early as at least five months prior to the dam
collapse on 25 January 2019. The results of this study demonstrate that the

to understand the intermittent nature of top-down control schemes in diverse
biological and engineered systems. Here, we introduce a new unsupervised
learning algorithm that uses recurrences in time series measurements to

theory of skew-product dynamical systems, we identify recurrence events shared
across response time series, which implicitly define a recurrence graph with
glass-like structure. As the amount or quality of observed data improves, this
recurrence graph undergoes a percolation transition manifesting as weak
ergodicity breaking for random walks on the induced landscape -- revealing the
shared driver's dynamics, even in the presence of strongly corrupted or noisy
measurements. Across several thousand random dynamical systems, we empirically
quantify the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on the rate of information
transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that
effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver's

or video segmentation, where the time-series have different timescales, are
irregularly sampled, or are shifted. However, it is not prone to be considered
as a loss function in an end-to-end learning framework because of its
non-differentiability and its quadratic temporal complexity. While
differentiable variants of DTW have been introduced by the community, they
still present some drawbacks: computing the distance is still expensive and
this similarity tends to blur some differences in the time-series. In this
paper, we propose a fast and differentiable approximation of DTW by comparing
two architectures: the first one for learning an embedding in which the
Euclidean distance mimics the DTW, and the second one for directly predicting
the DTW output using regression. We build the former by training a siamese
neural network to regress the DTW value between two time-series. Depending on
the nature of the activation function, this approximation naturally supports
differentiation, and it is efficient to compute. We show, in a time-series
retrieval context on EEG datasets, that our methods achieve at least the same
level of accuracy as other DTW main approximations with higher computational
efficiency. We also show that it can be used to learn in an end-to-end setting
on long time series by proposing generative models of EEGs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12873v1,cs.LG

called a reservoir, which has nonlinearities and short-term memory. In recent
years, reservoir computing has expanded to new functions such as the autonomous
generation of chaotic time series, as well as time series prediction and
classification. Furthermore, novel possibilities have been demonstrated, such
as inferring the existence of previously unseen attractors. Sampling, in
contrast, has a strong influence on such functions. Sampling is indispensable
in a physical reservoir computer that uses an existing physical system as a
reservoir because the use of an external digital system for the data input is
usually inevitable. This study analyzes the effect of sampling on the ability
of reservoir computing to autonomously regenerate chaotic time series. We

prone to adversarial attacks and studied their vulnerabilities. However, the
vulnerabilities of time series models for forecasting due to adversarial inputs
are not extensively explored. While the attack on a forecasting model might aim
to deteriorate the performance of the model, it is more effective, if the
attack is focused on a specific impact on the model's output. In this paper, we
propose a novel formulation of Directional, Amplitudinal, and Temporal targeted
adversarial attacks on time series forecasting models. These targeted attacks
create a specific impact on the amplitude and direction of the output
prediction. We use the existing adversarial attack techniques from the computer
vision domain and adapt them for time series. Additionally, we propose a
modified version of the Auto Projected Gradient Descent attack for targeted
attacks. We examine the impact of the proposed targeted attacks versus
untargeted attacks. We use KS-Tests to statistically demonstrate the impact of
the attack. Our experimental results show how targeted attacks on time series

we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for
continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations.
NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics,
thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging
techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to
perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three

aligns the points in two series with one another. These alignments support
warping of the time dimension to allow for processes that unfold at differing
rates. The distance is the minimum sum of costs of the resulting alignments
over any allowable warping of the time dimension. The cost of an alignment of
two points is a function of the difference in the values of those points. The
original cost function was the absolute value of this difference. Other cost
functions have been proposed. A popular alternative is the square of the
difference. However, to our knowledge, this is the first investigation of both
the relative impacts of using different cost functions and the potential to
tune cost functions to different tasks. We do so in this paper by using a
tunable cost function {\lambda}{\gamma} with parameter {\gamma}. We show that
higher values of {\gamma} place greater weight on larger pairwise differences,

Dictionary-based methods for TSC rely on counting the frequency of certain
patterns in time series and are important components of the currently most
accurate TSC ensembles. One of the early dictionary-based methods was WEASEL,
which at its time achieved SotA results while also being very fast. However, it
is outperformed both in terms of speed and accuracy by other methods.
Furthermore, its design leads to an unpredictably large memory footprint,
making it inapplicable for many applications.
  In this paper, we present WEASEL 2.0, a complete overhaul of WEASEL based on
two recent advancements in TSC: Dilation and ensembling of randomized
hyper-parameter settings. These two techniques allow WEASEL 2.0 to work with a
fixed-size memory footprint while at the same time improving accuracy. Compared
to 15 other SotA methods on the UCR benchmark set, WEASEL 2.0 is significantly
more accurate than other dictionary methods and not significantly worse than
the currently best methods. Actually, it achieves the highest median accuracy

Transformer-based models have achieved good performance in many long-term

methods. First, the training paradigm of contrastive learning and downstream
prediction tasks are inconsistent, leading to inaccurate prediction results.
Second, existing Transformer-based models which resort to similar patterns in
historical time series data for predicting future values generally induce
severe distribution shift problems, and do not fully leverage the sequence
information compared to self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework named Ti-MAE, in which the input time series are
assumed to follow an integrate distribution. In detail, Ti-MAE randomly masks
out embedded time series data and learns an autoencoder to reconstruct them at
the point-level. Ti-MAE adopts mask modeling (rather than contrastive learning)
as the auxiliary task and bridges the connection between existing
representation learning and generative Transformer-based methods, reducing the
difference between upstream and downstream forecasting tasks while maintaining
the utilization of original time series data. Experiments on several public

a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in
practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled
samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series
Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph
neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label
settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic
complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series
classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.
Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to
approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining
the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.
We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for
the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets

analysis. Current methods for dimension reduction in functional data are
functional principal component analysis and functional autoencoders, which are
limited to linear mappings or scalar representations for the time series, which
is inefficient. In real data applications, the nature of the data is much more
complex. We propose a non-linear function-on-function approach, which consists
of a functional encoder and a functional decoder, that uses continuous hidden
layers consisting of continuous neurons to learn the structure inherent in
functional data, which addresses the aforementioned concerns in the existing
approaches. Our approach gives a low dimension latent representation by
reducing the number of functional features as well as the timepoints at which
the functions are observed. The effectiveness of the proposed model is
demonstrated through multiple simulations and real data examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00357v1,cs.LG

approximate nonlinear functions of high dimensional variables much more
flexibly than various linear sieves (or series). This paper considers general
nonlinear sieve quasi-likelihood ratio (GN-QLR) based inference on expectation
functionals of time series data, where the functionals of interest are based on
some nonparametric function that satisfy conditional moment restrictions and
are learned using multilayer neural networks. While the asymptotic normality of
the estimated functionals depends on some unknown Riesz representer of the
functional space, we show that the optimally weighted GN-QLR statistic is
asymptotically Chi-square distributed, regardless whether the expectation
functional is regular (root-$n$ estimable) or not. This holds when the data are
weakly dependent beta-mixing condition. We apply our method to the off-policy
evaluation in reinforcement learning, by formulating the Bellman equation into
the conditional moment restriction framework, so that we can make inference
about the state-specific value functional using the proposed GN-QLR method with
time series data. In addition, estimating the averaged partial means and
averaged partial derivatives of nonparametric instrumental variables and
quantile IV models are also presented as leading examples. Finally, a Monte

applied in the industry. Since manual data annotation is expensive and
inefficient, most applications adopt unsupervised anomaly detection methods,
but the results are usually sub-optimal and unsatisfactory to end customers.
Weak supervision is a promising paradigm for obtaining considerable labels in a
low-cost way, which enables the customers to label data by writing heuristic
rules rather than annotating each instance individually. However, in the
time-series domain, it is hard for people to write reasonable labeling
functions as the time-series data is numerically continuous and difficult to be
understood. In this paper, we propose a Label-Efficient Interactive Time-Series
Anomaly Detection (LEIAD) system, which enables a user to improve the results
of unsupervised anomaly detection by performing only a small amount of
interactions with the system. To achieve this goal, the system integrates weak
supervision and active learning collaboratively while generating labeling
functions automatically using only a few labeled data. All of these techniques
are complementary and can promote each other in a reinforced manner. We conduct
experiments on three time-series anomaly detection datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed system is superior to existing solutions in both weak supervision

and clustering for time series data. Despite the considerable progress, the
existing deep time series clustering approaches mostly seek to train the deep
neural network by some instance reconstruction based or cluster distribution
based objective, which, however, lack the ability to exploit the sample-wise
(or augmentation-wise) contrastive information or even the higher-level (e.g.,
cluster-level) contrastiveness for learning discriminative and
clustering-friendly representations. In light of this, this paper presents a
deep temporal contrastive clustering (DTCC) approach, which for the first time,
to our knowledge, incorporates the contrastive learning paradigm into the deep
time series clustering research. Specifically, with two parallel views
generated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two
identical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the
meantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means
objective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously
enforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive
information, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder,
the cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly
optimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and
the clustering result can thereby be obtained. Experiments on a variety of time

industrial domains that monitor metrics in order to prevent potential accidents

definitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised
machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem
using either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While
traditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive
and can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first
highlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and
reconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly
scores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that
combines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the
successes and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce
bi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original
time series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose
several ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a
series of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER
architecture against two prediction-based methods and three
reconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets
from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest

challenge is to reconstruct grass growth from two sources of information: usual

year. We have to be able to capture the effect of seasonal climatic events
which are known to distort the growth curve within the year. In this paper, we
formulate this challenge as a problem of disaggregating the cumulative growth
into a time series. To address this problem, our method applies time series
forecasting using climate information and grass growth from previous time

Rather, these methods construct local temporal and multivariate correlations
within subsequences, but fail to capture correlations among subsequences, which
significantly affect their forecasting accuracy. To capture the temporal and
multivariate correlations among subsequences, we design a pattern discovery
model, that constructs correlations via diverse pattern functions. While the
traditional pattern discovery method uses shared and fixed pattern functions
that ignore the diversity across time series. We propose a novel pattern

Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping distance are known to be extremely

meaningfulness of such comparisons is less clear. For example, on two separate
days the telemetry from an athlete workout routine might be very similar. The
second day may change the order in of performing push-ups and squats, adding
repetitions of pull-ups, or completely omitting dumbbell curls. Any of these
minor changes would defeat existing time series distance measures. Some

forecasting strategies: Direct Forecasting and Iterative Forecasting, where the

generated and observed data. We theoretically prove that GenF is able to better
balance the forecasting variance and bias, leading to a much smaller

observation. This fact raises questions about how long the generated hidden
state is sufficient and whether it is effective when long sequences are used
instead of the typically used shorter sequences. In this article, we introduce
CrossPyramid, a novel ODE-based model that aims to enhance the generalizability
of sequences representation. CrossPyramid does not rely only on the hidden
state from the last observed value; it also considers ODE latent
representations learned from other samples. The main idea of our proposed model
is to define the hidden state for the unobserved values based on the non-linear
correlation between samples. Accordingly, CrossPyramid is built with three
distinctive parts: (1) ODE Auto-Encoder to learn the best data representation.
(2) Pyramidal attention method to categorize the learned representations

Cross-level ODE-RNN to integrate the previously learned information and provide
the final latent state for each sample. Through extensive experiments on

sequential data (e.g., time series), called the \textit{sequential predictive
conformal inference} (\texttt{SPCI}). We specifically account for the nature
that time series data are non-exchangeable, and thus many existing conformal
prediction algorithms are not applicable. The main idea is to adaptively
re-estimate the conditional quantile of non-conformity scores (e.g., prediction
residuals), upon exploiting the temporal dependence among them. More precisely,
we cast the problem of conformal prediction interval as predicting the quantile
of a future residual, given a user-specified point prediction algorithm.
Theoretically, we establish asymptotic valid conditional coverage upon
extending consistency analyses in quantile regression. Using simulation and
real-data experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in interval width
of \texttt{SPCI} compared to other existing methods under the desired empirical
coverage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03463v3,stat.ML

one forward operation, the basic configurations in existing MTSF Transformer
architectures were barely carefully verified. In this study, we point out that
the current tokenization strategy in MTSF Transformer architectures ignores the
token uniformity inductive bias of Transformers. Therefore, the vanilla MTSF
transformer struggles to capture details in time series and presents inferior
performance. Based on this observation, we make a series of evolution on the
basic architecture of the vanilla MTSF transformer. We vary the flawed
tokenization strategy, along with the decoder structure and embeddings.
Surprisingly, the evolved simple transformer architecture is highly effective,
which successfully avoids the over-smoothing phenomena in the vanilla MTSF

the domain shift problem via transferring the knowledge from a labeled source
domain to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Despite the prevalence of UDA for
visual applications, it remains relatively less explored for time-series
applications. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight contrastive domain
adaptation framework called CoTMix for time-series data. Unlike existing
approaches that either use statistical distances or adversarial techniques, we
leverage contrastive learning solely to mitigate the distribution shift across
the different domains. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal mixup strategy
to generate two intermediate augmented views for the source and target domains.
Subsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity
between each domain and its corresponding augmented view. The generated views
consider the temporal dynamics of time-series data during the adaptation
process while inheriting the semantics among the two domains. Hence, we
gradually push both domains towards a common intermediate space, mitigating the
distribution shift across them. Extensive experiments conducted on five

outperform all state-of-the-art UDA methods. The implementation code of CoTMix

intelligent transportation systems and data-driven decision-making processes.
To make an accurate reconstruction from partially observed traffic data, we
assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in traffic
time series. In the literature, substantial prior works have demonstrated the
effectiveness of utilizing low-rankness property of traffic data by
matrix/tensor completion models. In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian
kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic
time series, which can be formulated in the form of circular convolution. Then,
we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by
putting the nuclear norm of a circulant matrix and the Laplacian temporal
regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that takes
a fast Fourier transform (FFT) solution in a relatively low time complexity.
Through extensive experiments on some traffic datasets, we demonstrate the
superiority of LCR for imputing traffic time series of various time series
behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity). The proposed LCR
model is an efficient and effective solution to large-scale traffic data
imputation over the existing baseline models. Despite the LCR's application to

Contrastive learning has recently shown its promising representation learning
capability in the absence of expert annotations. However, existing contrastive

negative pairs that share the same semantics. To tackle this problem, we
propose MHCCL, a Masked Hierarchical Cluster-wise Contrastive Learning model,
which exploits semantic information obtained from the hierarchical structure
consisting of multiple latent partitions for multivariate time series.
Motivated by the observation that fine-grained clustering preserves higher
purity while coarse-grained one reflects higher-level semantics, we propose a
novel downward masking strategy to filter out fake negatives and supplement
positives by incorporating the multi-granularity information from the
clustering hierarchy. In addition, a novel upward masking strategy is designed
in MHCCL to remove outliers of clusters at each partition to refine prototypes,

for non-linear time series forecasting during the past few decades, due to
their simplicity and mathematical properties. On the other hand, in the
forecasting community, general-purpose tree-based regression algorithms
(forests, gradient-boosting) have become popular recently due to their ease of
use and accuracy. In this paper, we explore the close connections between TAR
models and regression trees. These enable us to use the rich methodology from
the literature on TAR models to define a hierarchical TAR model as a regression
tree that trains globally across series, which we call SETAR-Tree. In contrast
to the general-purpose tree-based models that do not primarily focus on
forecasting, and calculate averages at the leaf nodes, we introduce a new
forecasting-specific tree algorithm that trains global Pooled Regression (PR)
models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information and
also uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. The
depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test
commonly employed in TAR models, as well as measuring the error reduction
percentage at each node split. Thus, the proposed tree model requires minimal
external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its
default configuration. We also use this tree algorithm to develop a forest
where the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees are
combined during the forecasting process. In our evaluation on eight publicly
available datasets, the proposed tree and forest models are able to achieve
significantly higher accuracy than a set of state-of-the-art tree-based
algorithms and forecasting benchmarks across four evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08661v1,cs.LG

learning models as they can easily control the model's test-time predictions by
pre-injecting a backdoor trigger into the model at training time. While
backdoor attacks have been extensively studied on images, few works have
investigated the threat of backdoor attacks on time series data. To fill this
gap, in this paper we present a novel generative approach for time series
backdoor attacks against deep learning based time series classifiers. Backdoor
attacks have two main goals: high stealthiness and high attack success rate. We
find that, compared to images, it can be more challenging to achieve the two
goals on time series. This is because time series have fewer input dimensions
and lower degrees of freedom, making it hard to achieve a high attack success
rate without compromising stealthiness. Our generative approach addresses this
challenge by generating trigger patterns that are as realistic as real-time
series patterns while achieving a high attack success rate without causing a
significant drop in clean accuracy. We also show that our proposed attack is
resistant to potential backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we propose a novel
universal generator that can poison any type of time series with a single
generator that allows universal attacks without the need to fine-tune the
generative model for new time series datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07915v5,cs.LG

CPU utilization, allocated memory, disk and network latency, and predicts the
system metrics to prevent performance degradation. Nevertheless, building an
effective prediction model in this scenario is rather challenging as the model
has to accurately capture the long-range coupling dependency in the
Multivariate Time-Series (MTS). Moreover, this model needs to have low
computational complexity and can scale efficiently to the dimension of data

decisions has been a persistent challenge for researchers and end-users.
Explaining time-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications
with high stakes to understand the behavior of prediction models. However,
existing approaches to explain such models are frequently unique to data where
the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we introduce
WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series classifiers
using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the computational
complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series data as well as
improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on partitioning a
sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present three distinct
algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each evaluated
against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using perturbation and
sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to clinical time-series
data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) as
well as a broad clinical domain (critical care medicine). The experimental
results demonstrate that, based on the two quantitative metrics, our framework
is superior at explaining clinical time-series classifiers, while also reducing
the complexity of computations. We show that for time-series data with 120 time
steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent time points can reduce the CPU time of
WindowSHAP by 80% compared to KernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic
WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on the most important time steps and provides
more understandable explanations. As a result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates
the calculation of Shapley values for time-series data, but also delivers more
understandable explanations with higher quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06507v2,cs.LG

uncertainty estimation. There is a set of expectations regarding how
uncertainty should ``behave"". For instance, a wider prediction horizon should
lead to more uncertainty or the model's confidence should be proportional to
its accuracy. In this paper, different uncertainty estimation methods are

systematically examine the performance of machine learning models for the
clinical prediction task based on the EHR, especially physiological time

meaningful repeated patterns in time series. Recently, time series chains were
introduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous
evolving patterns in time series data. Informally, a time series chain (TSC) is
a temporally ordered set of time series subsequences, in which every
subsequence is similar to the one that precedes it, but the last and the first
can be arbitrarily dissimilar. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent
continuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of
unusual events in complex systems. Despite its promising interpretability,
unfortunately, we have observed that existing TSC definitions lack the ability
to accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains
can be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them
impractical in real-world applications. Inspired by a recent work that tracks
how the nearest neighbor of a time series subsequence changes over time, we
introduce a new TSC definition which is much more robust to noise in the data,
in the sense that they can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding
the non-evolving ones. We further propose two new quality metrics to rank the
discovered chains. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that
the proposed TSC definition is significantly more robust to noise than the

estimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials. The main tenet of
the SRL is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order

inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of
evidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be
applied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series
during the model fitting process, becoming especially useful in settings with
uncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate
exogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature
selection. The fitting process is quick even for large series with a

domains, such as energy, weather, traffic, and economy. As shown in various
types of data, it has been a must-see issue to deal with drastic changes,
temporal patterns, and shapes in sequential data that previous models are weak
in prediction. This is because most cases in time-series forecasting aim to
minimize $L_p$ norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error
(MAE) or mean square error (MSE). These loss functions are vulnerable to not
only considering temporal dynamics modeling but also capturing the shape of
signals. In addition, these functions often make models misbehave and return
uncorrelated results to the original time-series. To become an effective loss
function, it has to be invariant to the set of distortions between two
time-series data instead of just comparing exact values. In this paper, we
propose a novel loss function, called TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss
function with Distance EQuilibrium), that not only considers the distortions in
amplitude and phase but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series
sequences. In addition, TILDE-Q supports modeling periodic and non-periodic

volatility. There are often structural changes in volatility over time, and an
accurate estimation of the volatility of financial time series requires careful
identification of change-points. A common approach to modeling the volatility
of time series data is the well-known GARCH model. Although the problem of
change-point estimation of volatility dynamics derived from the GARCH model has
been considered in the literature, these approaches rely on parametric
assumptions of the conditional error distribution, which are often violated in
financial time series. This may lead to inaccuracies in change-point detection
resulting in unreliable GARCH volatility estimates. This paper introduces a
novel change-point detection algorithm based on a semiparametric GARCH model.
The proposed method retains the structural advantages of the GARCH process
while incorporating the flexibility of nonparametric conditional error
distribution. The approach utilizes a penalized likelihood derived from a
semiparametric GARCH model and an efficient binary segmentation algorithm. The
results show that in terms of change-point estimation and detection accuracy,
the semiparametric method outperforms the commonly used Quasi-MLE (QMLE) and
other variations of GARCH models in wide-ranging scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11520v1,stat.ME

via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and
lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals.
Dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity
into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a
challenging problem. Our method first addresses irregularity in each single
modality by (1) modeling irregular time series by dynamically incorporating
hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a
gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as
multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time
attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal fusion
with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in
multimodalities for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two
medical prediction tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
baselines in each single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios.
Specifically, we observe relative improvements of 6.5\%, 3.6\%, and 4.3\% in F1

we perform the Kalman filter as if error variables are uncorrelated; that is,
univariate time-series analyses are conducted separately to avoid a large

solution consists of multiple RNN-based layers and an attention layer: each
RNN-based layer automatically learns the temporal pattern of a specific series

Network entropy (NNetEn) and their 2D analogies. A new method for calculating
SvdEn2D, PermEn2D and SampEn2D for 2D images was tested using the technique of

the classes. Instead, when a classifier is choosing between many classes, an
effective explanation must show what sets the chosen class apart from the rest.
We now formalize this notion, studying the open problem of class-specific

problem setting. We design a novel explainability method, DEMUX, which learns
saliency maps for explaining deep multi-class time series classifiers by
adaptively ensuring that its explanation spotlights the regions in an input

a gradient-based approach composed of three interdependent modules that combine
to generate consistent, class-specific saliency maps that remain faithful to
the classifier's behavior yet are easily understood by end users. Our
experimental study demonstrates that DEMUX outperforms nine state-of-the-art

maximum likelihood estimation and multiple imputation using state space model
approaches to adapt the ADF test to a context with missing data. We further

continuous-time models. We train models to capture the causal structure by
enforcing sparsity in the weights of the input layers of the dynamics models.
We first verify the effectiveness of our method in the scenario where the exact
causal-structures of time-series are known as a priori. We next apply our

can automatically suppress the unimportant features while enhancing the
effective ones, so that users do not have to struggle with feature selection.

series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple
intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time
series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal
variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of

interest, whether for data augmentation, scenario simulation, completing
missing data, or other purposes. Recent works proposed a Transformer-based Time
series generative adversarial network (TTS-GAN) to address the limitations of
recurrent neural networks. However, this model assumes a unimodal distribution
and tries to generate samples around the expectation of the real data
distribution. One of its limitations is that it may generate a random
multivariate time series; it may fail to generate samples in the presence of
multiple sub-components within an overall distribution. One could train models
to fit each sub-component separately to overcome this limitation. Our work
extends the TTS-GAN by conditioning its generated output on a particular
encoded context allowing the use of one model to fit a mixture distribution
with multiple sub-components. Technically, it is a conditional generative
adversarial network that models realistic multivariate time series under
different types of conditions, such as categorical variables or multivariate
time series. We evaluate our model on UniMiB Dataset, which contains
acceleration data following the XYZ axes of human activities collected using
Smartphones. We use qualitative evaluations and quantitative metrics such as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and we introduce a modified version of the
Frechet inception distance (FID) to measure the performance of our model and
the statistical similarities between the generated and the real data

maintain service quality and provide early alarms. Generative neural network
methods are one class of the unsupervised approaches that are achieving
increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have proposed an
unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection
framework, DEGAN. It relies solely on normal time series data as input to train
a well-configured discriminator (D) into a standalone anomaly predictor. In
this framework, time series data is processed by the sliding window method.
Expected normal patterns in data are leveraged to develop a generator (G)
capable of generating normal data patterns. Normal data is also utilized in
hyperparameter tuning and D model selection steps. Validated D models are then
extracted and applied to evaluate unseen (testing) time series and identify
patterns that have anomalous characteristics. Kernel density estimation (KDE)
is applied to data points that are likely to be anomalous to generate
probability density functions on the testing time series. The segments with the
highest relative probabilities are detected as anomalies. To evaluate the
performance, we tested on univariate acceleration time series for five miles of
a Class I railroad track. We implemented the framework to detect the real
anomalous observations identified by operators. The results show that
leveraging the framework with a CNN D architecture results in average best
recall and precision of 80% and 86%, respectively, which demonstrates that a
well-trained standalone D model has the potential to be a reliable anomaly
detector. Moreover, the influence of GAN hyperparameters, GAN architectures,

critical to electricity grid stability and power dispatching capabilities.
However, Photovoltaic (PV) power generation is highly volatile and unstable due
to different reasons. The Wavelet Transform (WT) has been utilised in time

stochastic volatility and reduce prediction errors. Yet the existing Wavelet
Transform (WT) approach has a limitation in terms of time complexity. It
requires reconstructing the decomposed components and modelling them separately

The aim of this study is to improve the efficiency of applying Wavelet
Transform (WT) by proposing a new method that uses a single simplified model.
Given a time series and its Wavelet Transform (WT) coefficients, it trains one

making a short-to-mid-term electricity demand forecast, or the oil price
forecasts when making an airplane departure forecast. Existing machine learning
forecasting frameworks can be categorized into (1) sample-based approaches
where each forecast is made independently, and (2) time series regression
approaches where the future information is not fully incorporated. To overcome
the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MMMF, a framework to train
any neural network model capable of generating a sequence of outputs, that
combines both the temporal information from the past and the known information
about the future to make better predictions. Experiments are performed on two
real-world datasets for (1) mid-term electricity demand forecasting, and (2)

Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them

and are difficult to inspect. Interpretable machine learning models can aid in
discovering patterns in data as well as give easy-to-understand insights to
domain specialists. In this study, we present Neuro-Symbolic Time Series
Classification (NSTSC), a neuro-symbolic model that leverages signal temporal
logic (STL) and neural network (NN) to accomplish TSC tasks using multi-view
data representation and expresses the model as a human-readable, interpretable
formula. In NSTSC, each neuron is linked to a symbolic expression, i.e., an STL
(sub)formula. The output of NSTSC is thus interpretable as an STL formula akin
to natural language, describing temporal and logical relations hidden in the
data. We propose an NSTSC-based classifier that adopts a decision-tree approach
to learn formula structures and accomplish a multiclass TSC task. The proposed
smooth activation functions for wSTL allow the model to be learned in an
end-to-end fashion. We test NSTSC on a real-world wound healing dataset from
mice and benchmark datasets from the UCR time-series repository, demonstrating
that NSTSC achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models.
Furthermore, NSTSC can generate interpretable formulas that match with domain

critical. Learning using privileged information (LuPI) offers increased sample
efficiency by allowing prediction models access to auxiliary information at
training time which is unavailable when the models are used. In recent work, it
was shown that for prediction in linear-Gaussian dynamical systems, a LuPI
learner with access to intermediate time series data is never worse and often
better in expectation than any unbiased classical learner. We provide new
insights into this analysis and generalize it to nonlinear prediction tasks in
latent dynamical systems, extending theoretical guarantees to the case where
the map connecting latent variables and observations is known up to a linear
transform. In addition, we propose algorithms based on random features and
representation learning for the case when this map is unknown. A suite of

the unknown latent distributions within. To this end, we propose DIVERSIFY to
learn generalized representations for time series classification. DIVERSIFY
takes an iterative process: it first obtains the worst-case distribution
scenario via adversarial training, then matches the distributions of the
obtained sub-domains. We also present some theoretical insights. We conduct
experiments on gesture recognition, speech commands recognition, wearable
stress and affect detection, and sensor-based human activity recognition with a

Retrieving Autoregressive Network for Static features (FRANS) that does not

of series of the same class. It allows to discriminate series with similar
behaviour but from different classes and makes the features extracted from the

Although the existing gradient-based attacks achieve state-of-the-art
performance in feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, they do not
perform as well on time series classification with recurrent neural network
(RNN) models. This is because the cyclical structure of RNN prevents direct
model differentiation and the visual sensitivity of time series data to
perturbations challenges the traditional local optimization objective of the
adversarial attack. In this paper, a black-box method called TSFool is proposed
to efficiently craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN
classifiers. We propose a novel global optimization objective named Camouflage
Coefficient to consider the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the
perspective of class distribution, and accordingly refine the adversarial
attack as a multi-objective optimization problem to enhance the perturbation
quality. To get rid of the dependence on gradient information, we also propose
a new idea that introduces a representation model for RNN to capture deeply
embedded vulnerable samples having otherness between their features and latent
manifold, based on which the optimization solution can be heuristically
approximated. Experiments on 10 UCR datasets are conducted to confirm that
TSFool averagely outperforms existing methods with a 46.3% higher attack

partial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics
of sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge

deviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential
relations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics? In this
work, we propose an learning framework that can automatically obtain
interpretable PDE models from sequential data. Particularly, this framework is
comprised of learnable differential blocks, named $P$-blocks, which is proved
to be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in
theory. Moreover, to capture the dynamics shift, this framework introduces a
meta-learning controller to dynamically optimize the hyper-parameters of a
hybrid PDE model. Extensive experiments on times series forecasting of

methods of predicting correlation matrices utilize time series data of all the

performance on the M4 dataset. Extensive ablation studies show that Persistence
Initialization leads to better performance and faster convergence. As the size

battery-powered applications from failing unexpectedly. With the superiority of
reducing the data requirement of model training for new batteries, transfer
learning (TL) emerges as a promising machine learning approach that applies
knowledge learned from a source battery, which has a large amount of data.
However, the determination of whether the source battery model is reasonable
and which part of information can be transferred for SOH estimation are rarely
discussed, despite these being critical components of a successful TL. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable TL-based SOH
estimation method by exploiting the temporal dynamic to assist transfer
learning, which consists of three parts. First, with the help of dynamic time
warping, the temporal data from the discharge time series are synchronized,
yielding the warping path of the cycle-synchronized time series responsible for
capacity degradation over cycles. Second, the canonical variates retrieved from
the spatial path of the cycle-synchronized time series are used for
distribution similarity analysis between the source and target batteries.
Third, when the distribution similarity is within the predefined threshold, a
comprehensive target SOH estimation model is constructed by transferring the
common temporal dynamics from the source SOH estimation model and compensating
the errors with a residual model from the target battery. Through a widely-used
open-source benchmark dataset, the estimation error of the proposed method

crucial in various downstream machine learning tasks. In multivariate time
series forecasting, each variable depends on its historical values and there
are inter-dependencies among variables as well. Models have to be designed to
capture both intra- and inter-relationships among the time series. To move
towards this goal, we propose the Time Series Attention Transformer (TSAT) for
multivariate time series representation learning. Using TSAT, we represent both
temporal information and inter-dependencies of multivariate time series in
terms of edge-enhanced dynamic graphs. The intra-series correlations are
represented by nodes in a dynamic graph; a self-attention mechanism is modified
to capture the inter-series correlations by using the super-empirical mode
decomposition (SMD) module. We applied the embedded dynamic graphs to times
series forecasting problems, including two real-world datasets and two
benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that TSAT clearly outerperforms
six state-of-the-art baseline methods in various forecasting horizons. We

dilated convolution and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) respectively. Furthermore,
our approach can comprehend temporal contexts and feature correlations by
combining spatial-temporal masked self-supervised representation learning and

between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for
lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we
propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs)
that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by
contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate
two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To
demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from
simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs

autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than

application of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks for
spatiotemporal modeling. Based on previous work in computer vision on image
inpainting, this paper shows how three-dimensional spatiotemporal partial
convolutions can be used as layers in neural networks to fill gaps in satellite
image time series. To evaluate the approach, we apply a U-Net-like model on
incomplete image time series of quasi-global carbon monoxide observations from
the Sentinel-5P satellite. Prediction errors were comparable to two considered
statistical approaches while computation times for predictions were up to three
orders of magnitude faster, making the approach applicable to process large
amounts of satellite data. Partial convolutions can be added as layers to other
types of neural networks, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing

many other machine learning fields. Although it appears that the accuracy has
been increasing as the model is updated in a number of publicly available
datasets, it typically only increases the scale by several times in exchange
for a slight difference in accuracy. Through this experiment, we point out a
different line of thinking, time series, especially long-term forecasting, may
differ from other fields. It is not necessary to use extensive and complex
models to grasp all aspects of time series, but to use pure models to grasp the
core rules of time series changes. With this simple but effective idea, we
created PureTS, a network with three pure linear layers that achieved
state-of-the-art in 80% of the long sequence prediction tasks while being
nearly the lightest model and having the fastest running speed. On this basis,
we discuss the potential of pure linear layers in both phenomena and essence.
The ability to understand the core law contributes to the high precision of
long-distance prediction, and reasonable fluctuation prevents it from
distorting the curve in multi-step prediction like mainstream deep learning

time, but many applications require to classify time series at every time
point. e.g. the outcome of a critical patient is only determined at the end,

a new concept: Continuous Classification of Time Series (CCTS). It requires the
model to learn data in different time stages. But the time series evolves
dynamically, leading to different data distributions. When a model learns
multi-distribution, it always forgets or overfits. We suggest that meaningful
learning scheduling is potential due to an interesting observation: Measured by
confidence, the process of model learning multiple distributions is similar to
the process of human learning multiple knowledge. Thus, we propose a novel
Confidence-guided method for CCTS (C3TS). It can imitate the alternating human
confidence described by the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We define the objective-

F. Moura', 'Augusto Santos']","We study the problem of graph structure identification, i.e., of recovering
the graph of dependencies among time series. We model these time series data as
components of the state of linear stochastic networked dynamical systems. We
assume partial observability, where the state evolution of only a subset of
nodes comprising the network is observed. We devise a new feature vector
computed from the observed time series and prove that these features are
linearly separable, i.e., there exists a hyperplane that separates the cluster
of features associated with connected pairs of nodes from those associated with
disconnected pairs. This renders the features amenable to train a variety of
classifiers to perform causal inference. In particular, we use these features
to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The resulting causal inference
mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts w.r.t. sample-complexity.
The trained CNNs generalize well over structurally distinct networks (dense or
sparse) and noise-level profiles. Remarkably, they also generalize well to
real-world networks while trained over a synthetic network (realization of a
random graph). Finally, the proposed method consistently reconstructs the graph
in a pairwise manner, that is, by deciding if an edge or arrow is present or
absent in each pair of nodes, from the corresponding time series of each pair.

finance and economics. As a major dimension reduction tool, similar to its
factor model counterpart, the idiosyncratic components of a tensor time series
factor model can exhibit serial correlations, especially in financial and
economic applications. This rules out a lot of state-of-the-art methods that
assume white idiosyncratic components, or even independent/Gaussian data. While
the traditional higher order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) is proved to be
convergent to a set of factor loading matrices, the closeness of them to the
true underlying factor loading matrices are in general not established, or only
under some strict circumstances like having i.i.d. Gaussian noises (Zhang and
Xia, 2018). Under the presence of serial and cross-correlations in the
idiosyncratic components and time series variables with only bounded fourth
order moments, we propose a pre-averaging method that accumulates information
from tensor fibres for better estimating all the factor loading spaces. The
estimated directions corresponding to the strongest factors are then used for
projecting the data for a potentially improved re-estimation of the factor
loading spaces themselves, with theoretical guarantees and rate of convergence
spelt out. We also propose a new rank estimation method which utilizes
correlation information from the projected data, in the same spirit as Fan, Guo

is the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for
determining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially
designed to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the
latent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to
learn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time
series subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to
select the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the
reconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for
clustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of
the clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on
AUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series

single data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore,
desired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on
the dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an
unsupervised anomaly detection approach for multivariate time series anomaly
detection via dynamic graph and entity-aware normalizing flow, leaning only on
a widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities
than the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the
diverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges on
the density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated
possibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the
mutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning
model, which helps to model accurate distribution of multivariate time series.
Moreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual
entities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity
into a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained
density estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlow achieves
superior anomaly detection performance. Experiments on five public datasets

weakly dependent time processes, which has helped to inform implementation
(e.g., best block sizes). However, little is known about resampling performance

in block selection, we consider a broad class of strongly dependent time
processes, formed by a transformation of a stationary long-memory Gaussian
series, and examine block-based resampling estimators for the variance of the
prototypical sample mean; extensions to general statistical functionals are
also considered. Unlike weak dependence, the properties of resampling
estimators under strong dependence are shown to depend intricately on the
nature of non-linearity in the time series (beyond Hermite ranks) in addition
the long-memory coefficient and block size. Additionally, the intuition has
often been that optimal block sizes should be larger under strong dependence
(say $O(n^{1/2})$ for a sample size $n$) than the optimal order $O(n^{1/3})$
known under weak dependence. This intuition turns out to be largely incorrect,
though a block order $O(n^{1/2})$ may be reasonable (and even optimal) in many
cases, owing to non-linearity in a long-memory time series. While optimal block
sizes are more complex under long-range dependence compared to short-range, we

network architectures have been widely applied to the problem of time series
forecasting. Most of these models are trained by minimizing a loss function
that measures predictions' deviation from the real values. Typical loss
functions include mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In
the presence of noise and uncertainty, neural network models tend to replicate
the last observed value of the time series, thus limiting their applicability
to real-world data. In this paper, we provide a formal definition of the above
problem and we also give some examples of forecasts where the problem is
observed. We also propose a regularization term penalizing the replication of
previously seen values. We evaluate the proposed regularization term both on
synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the regularization
term mitigates to some extent the aforementioned problem and gives rise to more
robust models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13441v1,cs.LG

alarming potential faults of target systems in various domains. Current
state-of-the-art time series anomaly detectors mainly focus on devising
advanced neural network structures and new reconstruction/prediction learning
objectives to learn data normality (normal patterns and behaviors) as
accurately as possible. However, these one-class learning methods can be
deceived by unknown anomalies in the training data (i.e., anomaly
contamination). Further, their normality learning also lacks knowledge about
the anomalies of interest. Consequently, they often learn a biased, inaccurate
normality boundary. This paper proposes a novel one-class learning approach,
named calibrated one-class classification, to tackle this problem. Our
one-class classifier is calibrated in two ways: (1) by adaptively penalizing
uncertain predictions, which helps eliminate the impact of anomaly
contamination while accentuating the predictions that the one-class model is
confident in, and (2) by discriminating the normal samples from native anomaly
examples that are generated to simulate genuine time series abnormal behaviors
on the basis of original data. These two calibrations result in
contamination-tolerant, anomaly-informed one-class learning, yielding a
significantly improved normality modeling. Extensive experiments on six
real-world datasets show that our model substantially outperforms twelve
state-of-the-art competitors and obtains 6% - 31% F1 score improvement. The

Addressing this important limitation is a significant challenge. In this paper,

two-fold: we first describe a convolutional architecture that enables the
comparison of dimensions; then, we propose a method that returns dCAM, a
Dimension-wise Class Activation Map specifically designed for multivariate time

safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare. The
detection of a shift from the training distribution of individual datapoints

out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. But in many applications, the inputs to a
machine learning model form a temporal sequence. Existing techniques for OOD
detection in time-series data either do not exploit temporal relationships in
the sequence or do not provide any guarantees on detection. We propose using
deviation from the in-distribution temporal equivariance as the non-conformity

anomalistic behavior, while others may be anomalistic due to their frequency or
seasonal behavior or due to a change in the trend. In this paper we suggested
working on real time series of trades of Ethereum from specific accounts and

Notably, they generally rely on the complete time series to be available and

forecasting.
  Existing prediction research mostly focused on mapping past short sub-series

dataset time series will be discarded, once training is completed. Models can
merely rely on lookback window information for inference, which impedes models
from analyzing time series from a global perspective. And these windows used by
Transformers are quite narrow because they must model each time-step therein.
Under this point-wise processing style, broadening windows will rapidly exhaust
their model capacity. This, for fine-grained time series, leads to a bottleneck
in information input and prediction output, which is mortal to long-term series
forecasting. To overcome the barrier, we propose a brand-new methodology to
utilize Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, we split time
series into patches by day and reform point-wise to patch-wise processing,
which considerably enhances the information input and output of Transformers.
To further help models leverage the whole training set's global information

Despite their success, little is known about their robustness to adversarial
attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial framework referred to as
Time-Series Attacks via STATistical Features (TSA-STAT)}. To address the unique
challenges of time-series domain, TSA-STAT employs constraints on statistical
features of the time-series data to construct adversarial examples. Optimized
polynomial transformations are used to create attacks that are more effective
(in terms of successfully fooling DNNs) than those based on additive
perturbations. We also provide certified bounds on the norm of the statistical

on the ability to detect the data which is not generated from the same
distribution as training data. This task is referred to as out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection. We consider the novel problem of OOD detection for the
time-series domain. We discuss the unique challenges posed by time-series data
and explain why prior methods from the image domain will perform poorly.
Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel {\em Seasonal Ratio
Scoring (SRS)} approach. SRS consists of three key algorithmic steps. First,
each input is decomposed into class-wise semantic component and remainder.
Second, this decomposition is employed to estimate the class-wise conditional
likelihoods of the input and remainder using deep generative models. The
seasonal ratio score is computed from these estimates. Third, a threshold
interval is identified from the in-distribution data to detect OOD examples.
Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the SRS method is
well-suited for time-series OOD detection when compared to baseline methods.

applications over time-series data such as mobile health, little is known about
how to train robust DNNs for time-series domain due to its unique
characteristics compared to images and text data. In this paper, we propose a
novel algorithmic framework referred as RObust Training for Time-Series (RO-TS)
to create robust DNNs for time-series classification tasks. Specifically, we
formulate a min-max optimization problem over the model parameters by
explicitly reasoning about the robustness criteria in terms of additive
perturbations to time-series inputs measured by the global alignment kernel
(GAK) based distance. We also show the generality and advantages of our
formulation using the summation structure over time-series alignments by
relating both GAK and dynamic time warping (DTW). This problem is an instance
of a family of compositional min-max optimization problems, which are
challenging and open with unclear theoretical guarantee. We propose a
principled stochastic compositional alternating gradient descent ascent
(SCAGDA) algorithm for this family of optimization problems. Unlike traditional
methods for time-series that require approximate computation of distance
measures, SCAGDA approximates the GAK based distance on-the-fly using a moving
average approach. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of SCAGDA and
provide strong theoretical support for the estimation of GAK based distance.
Our experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that RO-TS creates more
robust DNNs when compared to adversarial training using prior methods that rely
on data augmentation or new definitions of loss functions. We also demonstrate
the importance of GAK for time-series data over the Euclidean distance. The

we need to account for 1) the variable-length data drawn from 2) different

networks use global pooling after convolutional layers to cancel the length
differences. This architecture suffers from the trade-off between incorporating
entire temporal correlations in long data and avoiding feature collapse for
short data. To resolve this tradeoff, we propose Adaptive Multi-scale Pooling,
which aggregates features from an adaptive number of layers, i.e., only the
first few layers for short data and more layers for long data. Furthermore, to

anomalies as instances that do not follow the regular causal mechanism to

detecting anomalies and root causes. It first learns the causal structure from
data and then infers whether an instance is an anomaly relative to the local
causal mechanism whose conditional distribution can be directly estimated from

processes to generate different variables are irrelevant modules), the original
problem is divided into a series of separate, simpler, and low-dimensional

make prediction more robust.Built upon Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
theorem, we explicitly introduce feature selection, model ensemble, and a tree
structure to further utilize the extended input sequence, which improves the
robustness and representation power of TreeDRNet. Unlike previous deep models
for sequential forecasting work, TreeDRNet is built entirely on multilayer
perceptron and thus enjoys high computational efficiency. Our extensive
empirical studies show that TreeDRNet is significantly more effective than
state-of-the-art methods, reducing prediction errors by 20% to 40% for
multivariate time series. In particular, TreeDRNet is over 10 times more
efficient than transformer-based methods. The code will be released soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12106v1,cs.LG

representation learning. Our method employs expert features to replace the
commonly used data transformations in previous contrastive learning approaches.
We do this since time-series data frequently stems from the industrial or
medical field where expert features are often available from domain experts,
while transformations are generally elusive for time-series data. We start by
proposing two properties that useful time-series representations should fulfill
and show that current representation learning approaches do not ensure these
properties. We therefore devise ExpCLR, a novel contrastive learning approach
built on an objective that utilizes expert features to encourage both
properties for the learned representation. Finally, we demonstrate on three
real-world time-series datasets that ExpCLR surpasses several state-of-the-art
methods for both unsupervised and semi-supervised representation learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11517v1,cs.LG

Cucci', 'Lionel Voirol', 'Ga√´l Kermarrec', 'Jean-Philippe Montillet', 'St√©phane Guerrier']","The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) daily position time series are
often described as the sum of stochastic processes and geophysical signals
which allow studying global and local geodynamical effects such as plate
tectonics, earthquakes, or ground water variations. In this work we propose to
extend the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) to estimate the
parameters of linear models with correlated residuals. This statistical
inferential framework is applied to GNSS daily position time series data to
jointly estimate functional (geophysical) as well as stochastic noise models.
Our method is called GMWMX, with X standing for eXogeneous variable: it is
semi-parametric, computationally efficient and scalable. Unlike standard
methods such as the widely used Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), our
methodology offers statistical guarantees, such as consistency and asymptotic
normality, without relying on strong parametric assumptions. At the Gaussian
model, our results show that the estimated parameters are similar to the ones
obtained with the MLE. The computational performances of our approach has
important practical implications. Indeed, the estimation of the parameters of
large networks of thousands of GNSS stations quickly becomes computationally
prohibitive. Compared to standard methods, the processing time of the GMWMX is
over $1000$ times faster and allows the estimation of large scale problems
within minutes on a standard computer. We validate the performances of our
method via Monte-Carlo simulations by generating GNSS daily position time
series with missing observations and we consider composite stochastic noise
models including processes presenting long-range dependence such as power-law
or Mat\'ern processes. The advantages of our method are also illustrated using
real time series from GNSS stations located in the Eastern part of the USA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09668v1,stat.ME

can be predicted in advance to guide agencies and residents to respond to
changes in traffic patterns appropriately. However, existing works on traffic
forecasting mainly relied on historical traffic patterns confining to
short-term prediction, under 1 hour, for instance. To better manage future
roadway capacity and accommodate social and human impacts, it is crucial to
propose a flexible and comprehensive framework to predict physical-aware
long-term traffic conditions for public users and transportation agencies. In
this paper, the gap of robust long-term traffic forecasting was bridged by
taking social media features into consideration. A correlation study and a
linear regression model were first implemented to evaluate the significance of
the correlation between two time-series data, traffic intensity and Twitter
data intensity. Two time-series data were then fed into our proposed
social-aware framework, Traffic-Twitter Transformer, which integrated Nature
Language representations into time-series records for long-term traffic

However, speed and data reduction in many applications is equally important,
especially when the data scale and storage requirements increase rapidly.
Current MTSC algorithms need hundreds of compute hours to complete training and
prediction. This is due to the nature of multivariate time series data, which
grows with the number of time series, their length and the number of channels.
In many applications, not all the channels are useful for the classification
task; hence we require methods that can efficiently select useful channels and
thus save computational resources. We propose and evaluate two methods for
channel selection. Our techniques work by representing each class by a
prototype time series and performing channel selection based on the prototype
distance between classes. The main hypothesis is that useful channels enable
better separation between classes; hence, channels with the higher distance
between class prototypes are more useful. On the UEA Multivariate Time Series
Classification (MTSC) benchmark, we show that these techniques achieve
significant data reduction and classifier speedup for similar levels of
classification accuracy. Channel selection is applied as a pre-processing step
before training state-of-the-art MTSC algorithms and saves about 70\% of
computation time and data storage, with preserved accuracy. Furthermore, our
methods enable even efficient classifiers, such as ROCKET, to achieve better
accuracy than using no channel selection or forward channel selection. To
further study the impact of our techniques, we present experiments on
classifying synthetic multivariate time series datasets with more than 100
channels, as well as a real-world case study on a dataset with 50 channels. Our
channel selection methods lead to significant data reduction with preserved or
improved accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09274v2,cs.LG

of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have
become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the
spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and
sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited
by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data,
such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and
the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to
be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series
Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to
efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series
(e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These
representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input
to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments

of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly

time-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate
time-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on
point predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts
distributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also
impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution
which does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works
also silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given
hierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show
deviation from this assumption. We close both these gap and propose PROFHiT,
which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly
models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHiT uses a flexible
probabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency
regularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast
distribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to
datasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHiT over wide
range of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and

transformer-based models on time-series forecasting tasks: (i) learning
directly on raw data is susceptible to noise due to its complex and unstable
feature representation; (ii) the self-attention mechanisms pay insufficient
attention to changing features and temporal dependencies. In order to solve
these two problems, we propose a transformer-based differentially reconstructed

innovations: (i) learning against differenced sequences, which preserves clear
and stable sequence features by differencing and highlights the changing
properties of sequences; (ii) the reconstructed attention: integrated distance
attention exhibits sequential distance through a learnable Gaussian kernel,
distributed difference attention calculates distribution difference by mapping
the difference sequence to the adaptive feature space, and the combination of
the two effectively focuses on the sequences with prominent associations; (iii)
the reconstructed decoder input, which extracts sequence features by
integrating variation information and temporal correlations, thereby obtaining
a more comprehensive sequence representation. Extensive experiments on four

and local behaviour. Such advantages are especially critical for time series
with complicated trends. However, the known drawback is the high training time
compared to the autoregressive models and long-short term memory (LSTM)
networks widely used for data-driven time series modelling. Therefore, we
should be able to balance interpretability and training time to apply neural
ODE in practice. The paper shows that modern neural ODE cannot be reduced to
simpler models for time-series modelling applications. The complexity of neural
ODE is compared to or exceeds the conventional time-series modelling tools. The
only interpretation that could be extracted is the eigenspace of the operator,
which is an ill-posed problem for a large system. Spectra could be extracted

The drawback of existing physics-based simulation programs is that they require
significant manual modelling effort and computing time for generating time
resolved deterministic results. Yet, solar irradiation is highly intermittent

recourse to a label. Algorithms that cluster time series can be classified into
two groups: those that employ a time series specific distance measure; and
those that derive features from time series. Both approaches usually rely on
traditional clustering algorithms such as $k$-means. Our focus is on distance
based time series that employ elastic distance measures, i.e. distances that
perform some kind of realignment whilst measuring distance. We describe nine
commonly used elastic distance measures and compare their performance with
k-means and k-medoids clustering. Our findings are surprising. The most popular
technique, dynamic time warping (DTW), performs worse than Euclidean distance
with k-means, and even when tuned, is no better. Using k-medoids rather than
k-means improved the clusterings for all nine distance measures. DTW is not
significantly better than Euclidean distance with k-medoids. Generally,
distance measures that employ editing in conjunction with warping perform
better, and one distance measure, the move-split-merge (MSM) method, is the
best performing measure of this study. We also compare to clustering with DTW
using barycentre averaging (DBA). We find that DBA does improve DTW k-means,
but that the standard DBA is still worse than using MSM. Our conclusion is to
recommend MSM with k-medoids as the benchmark algorithm for clustering time
series with elastic distance measures. We provide implementations in the aeon
toolkit, results and guidance on reproducing results on the associated GitHub

global-range modeling ability. However, their performance can degenerate
terribly on non-stationary real-world data in which the joint distribution
changes over time. Previous studies primarily adopt stationarization to
attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability.
But the stationarized series deprived of inherent non-stationarity can be less
instructive for real-world bursty events forecasting. This problem, termed
over-stationarization in this paper, leads Transformers to generate
indistinguishable temporal attentions for different series and impedes the
predictive capability of deep models. To tackle the dilemma between series
predictability and model capability, we propose Non-stationary Transformers as
a generic framework with two interdependent modules: Series Stationarization
and De-stationary Attention. Concretely, Series Stationarization unifies the
statistics of each input and converts the output with restored statistics for
better predictability. To address the over-stationarization problem,
De-stationary Attention is devised to recover the intrinsic non-stationary
information into temporal dependencies by approximating distinguishable
attentions learned from raw series. Our Non-stationary Transformers framework
consistently boosts mainstream Transformers by a large margin, which reduces
MSE by 49.43% on Transformer, 47.34% on Informer, and 46.89% on Reformer,
making them the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting. Code is available

aggregated time-series data, which has remained an understudied problem though
it has several commercial applications. We first group time series at each
aggregated level, while simultaneously leveraging local and global information.
The proposed method can cluster hierarchical time series (HTS) with different
lengths and structures. For common two-level hierarchies, we employ a combined
objective for local and global clustering over spaces of discrete probability
measures, using Wasserstein distance coupled with Soft-DTW divergence. For
multi-level hierarchies, we present a bottom-up procedure that progressively
leverages lower-level information for higher-level clustering. Our final goal
is to improve both the accuracy and speed of forecasts for a larger number of
HTS needed for a real-world application. To attain this goal, each time series
is first assigned the forecast for its cluster representative, which can be
considered as a ""shrinkage prior"" for the set of time series it represents.
Then this base forecast can be quickly fine-tuned to adjust to the specifics of
that time series. We empirically show that our method substantially improves
performance in terms of both speed and accuracy for large-scale forecasting
tasks involving much HTS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14104v1,cs.LG

sensitive data in many medical, financial, and IoT applications. A common type
of multivariate time series originates from a single source such as the
biometric measurements from a medical patient. This leads to complex dynamical
patterns between individual time series that are hard to learn by typical
generation models such as GANs. There is valuable information in those patterns
that machine learning models can use to better classify, predict or perform
other downstream tasks. We propose a novel framework that takes time series'
common origin into account and favors channel/feature relationships
preservation. The two key points of our method are: 1) the individual time
series are generated from a common point in latent space and 2) a central
discriminator favors the preservation of inter-channel/feature dynamics. We

dynamic) graph is an effective representational framework that allows for
developing models for time series analysis. In fact, discrete sequences of
graphs can be processed by autoregressive graph neural networks to recursively
learn representations at each discrete point in time and space. Spatiotemporal
graphs are often highly sparse, with time series characterized by multiple,
concurrent, and long sequences of missing data, e.g., due to the unreliable
underlying sensor network. In this context, autoregressive models can be
brittle and exhibit unstable learning dynamics. The objective of this paper is,
then, to tackle the problem of learning effective models to reconstruct, i.e.,
impute, missing data points by conditioning the reconstruction only on the
available observations. In particular, we propose a novel class of
attention-based architectures that, given a set of highly sparse discrete
observations, learn a representation for points in time and space by exploiting
a spatiotemporal propagation architecture aligned with the imputation task.
Representations are trained end-to-end to reconstruct observations w.r.t. the
corresponding sensor and its neighboring nodes. Compared to the state of the
art, our model handles sparse data without propagating prediction errors or
requiring a bidirectional model to encode forward and backward time
dependencies. Empirical results on representative benchmarks show the

Traditional time-series anomaly detection methods capture underlying patterns

including econometrics and healthcare. A canonical example in healthcare is
predicting patient outcomes using physiological time-series data, where a
population of patients composes a cross-section. Reliable PI estimators in this
setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage
across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal
dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal
Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles
both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a
pre-specified quantile from the distribution of nonconformity scores on a
calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time $t$,
accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a

cumbersome sampling policy, and unstable performances when encountering

but received limited attention in academia. Most of the existing domain
adaptation methods for time-series data borrow the ideas from the existing
methods for non-time series data to extract the domain-invariant
representation. However, two peculiar difficulties to time-series data have not
been solved. 1) It is not a trivial task to model the domain-invariant and
complex dependence among different timestamps. 2) The domain-variant
information is important but how to leverage them is almost underexploited.
Fortunately, the stableness of causal structures among different domains
inspires us to explore the structures behind the time-series data. Based on
this inspiration, we investigate the domain-invariant unweighted sparse
associative structures and the domain-variant strengths of the structures. To
achieve this, we propose Sparse Associative structure alignment by learning
Invariance and Variance (SASA-IV in short), a model that simultaneously aligns
the invariant unweighted spare associative structures and considers the variant
information for time-series unsupervised domain adaptation. Technologically, we
extract the domain-invariant unweighted sparse associative structures with a
unidirectional alignment restriction and embed the domain-variant strengths via
a well-designed autoregressive module. Experimental results not only testify

the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods that focus on training speed.
LPC-AD is accurate in the sense that it improves the detection accuracy by as
high as 18.9% compared to SOTA sophisticated deep learning methods that focus
on enhancing detection accuracy. Methodologically, LPC-AD contributes a generic
architecture LPC-Reconstruct for one to attain different trade-offs between
training speed and detection accuracy. More specifically, LPC-Reconstruct is
built on ideas from autoencoder for reducing redundancy in time series, latent
predictive coding for capturing temporal dependence in MTS, and randomized
perturbation for avoiding overfitting of anomalous dependence in the training
data. We present simple instantiations of LPC-Reconstruct to attain fast
training speed, where we propose a simple randomized perturbation method. The
superior performance of LPC-AD over SOTA methods is validated by extensive

With the increasing availability of sensor data from industrial systems, being
able to detecting anomalies from streams of multivariate time series data is of
significant importance. Given the scarcity of anomalies in real-world
applications, the majority of literature has been focusing on modeling
normality. The learned normal representations can empower anomaly detection as
the model has learned to capture certain key underlying data regularities. A
typical formulation is to learn a predictive model, i.e., use a window of time
series data to predict future data values. In this paper, we propose an
alternative self-supervised learning task. By randomly masking a portion of the
inputs and training a model to estimate them using the remaining ones, MAD is
an improvement over the traditional left-to-right next step prediction (NSP)
task. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAD can achieve better anomaly
detection rates over traditional NSP approaches when using exactly the same

time series forecasting. While recent attention-based forecasting models show
strong abilities in capturing long-term dependencies, they still suffer from
two key limitations. First, canonical self attention has a quadratic complexity
w.r.t. the input time series length, thus falling short in efficiency. Second,
different variables' time series often have distinct temporal dynamics, which
existing studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space,
e.g., projection matrices, for all variables' time series, thus falling short
in accuracy. To ensure high efficiency and accuracy, we propose Triformer, a
triangular, variable-specific attention. (i) Linear complexity: we introduce a
novel patch attention with linear complexity. When stacking multiple layers of

different amounts of time to predict into the future. We also consider the
performance of the recent attention-based Transformer models, which has had

construct the estimator's asymptotic properties. Then, with the robust realized
integrated beta estimator, we propose a quasi-likelihood procedure for
estimating the model parameters based on the combined high-frequency data and
low frequency dynamic structure. We also establish asymptotic theorems for the

finite samples of the estimator. The empirical study with the S&P 500 index and
the top 50 large trading volume stocks from the S&P 500 illustrates that the

individual stocks and better predicts future market betas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06914v1,stat.ME

area of research as the quality of air is closely related to human health and
well-being. However, traditional statistics and shallow machine learning-based
approaches in anomaly detection in the IAQ area could not detect anomalies
involving the observation of correlations across several data points (i.e.,
often referred to as long-term dependences). We propose a hybrid deep learning
model that combines LSTM with Autoencoder for anomaly detection tasks in IAQ to
address this issue. In our approach, the LSTM network is comprised of multiple
LSTM cells that work with each other to learn the long-term dependences of the
data in a time-series sequence. Autoencoder identifies the optimal threshold
based on the reconstruction loss rates evaluated on every data across all
time-series sequences. Our experimental results, based on the Dunedin CO2
time-series dataset obtained through a real-world deployment of the schools in
New Zealand, demonstrate a very high and robust accuracy rate (99.50%) that

non-additive metrics that allows for the identification and interpretation of
contributing factors (input features) of variance. Non-additive metrics, such
as ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires
preceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the
metric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input
features and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along
elements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It
rules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a
function of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)
segmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that
are supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of
the metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)
transformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,
(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling
of the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the
aggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation
has been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level
univariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps
allows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum
of time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic
example that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail
credit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived
input features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process
Control has been introduced for the residual time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06688v1,cs.LG

catchment attributes that traditionally originate from catchment hydrology,
flood frequency analysis and their interplay. In this work, we deviated from
this traditional path by formulating and extensively investigating the first
regression-based streamflow regionalization frameworks that largely emerge from
general-purpose time series features for data science and, more precisely, from
a large variety of such features. We focused on 28 features that included
(partial) autocorrelation, entropy, temporal variation, seasonality, trend,
lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity, linearity, spikiness, curvature and others.
We estimated these features for daily temperature, precipitation and streamflow
time series from 511 catchments, and then merged them within regionalization
contexts with traditional topographic, land cover, soil and geologic
attributes. Precipitation and temperature features (e.g., the spectral entropy,
seasonality strength and lag-1 autocorrelation of the precipitation time
series, and the stability and trend strength of the temperature time series)
were found to be useful predictors of many streamflow features. The same
applies to traditional attributes, such as the catchment mean elevation.
Relationships between predictor and dependent variables were also revealed,
while the spectral entropy, the seasonality strength and several
autocorrelation features of the streamflow time series were found to be more
regionalizable than others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06540v2,stat.ME

consists of deciding whether an estimate of the memory parameter $d$
corresponds to LRD. Surprisingly, the literature offers numerous spectral
domain estimators for $d$ but there are only a few estimators in the time
domain. Moreover, the latter estimators are criticized for relying on visual
inspection to determine an observation window $[n_1, n_2]$ for a linear
regression to run on. Theoretically motivated choices of $n_1$ and $n_2$ are
often missing for many time series models.
  In this paper, we take the well-known variance plot estimator and provide
rigorous asymptotic conditions on $[n_1, n_2]$ to ensure the estimator's
consistency under LRD. We establish these conditions for a large class of
square-integrable time series models. This large class enables one to use the
variance plot estimator to detect LRD for infinite-variance time series (after
suitable transformation). Thus, detection of LRD for infinite-variance time
series is another novelty of our paper. A simulation study indicates that the
variance plot estimator can detect LRD better than the popular spectral domain

multivariate time-series datasets have different channels and ii) forecasting

problem in data mining, which has numerous applications. Existing
autoencoder-based approaches deliver state-of-the-art performance on
challenging real-world data but are vulnerable to outliers and exhibit low

explainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time

Improved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better
explained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities. We
provide insight into this by means of a post-hoc explainability analysis and
empirical studies. In addition, since outliers are separated from clean time
series iteratively, our approach offers improved robustness to outliers, which

high-dimensional time series, and their piecewise extensions allow for
structural changes in the data. In VAR modelling, the number of parameters grow
quadratically with the dimensionality which necessitates the sparsity
assumption in high dimensions. However, it is debatable whether such an
assumption is adequate for handling datasets exhibiting strong serial and
cross-sectional correlations. We propose a piecewise stationary time series
model that simultaneously allows for strong correlations as well as structural
changes, where pervasive serial and cross-sectional correlations are accounted
for by a time-varying factor structure, and any remaining idiosyncratic
dependence between the variables is handled by a piecewise stationary VAR
model. We propose an accompanying two-stage data segmentation methodology which
fully addresses the challenges arising from the latency of the component

be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

renewable energy are essential in several applications. These include stable
grid operation, profitable power trading, and forward-looking system planning.
However, there is a lack of publicly available datasets for research on machine

time series dataset with realistic synthetic power data. Other publicly and
non-publicly available datasets often lack precise geographic coordinates,
timestamps, or static power plant information, e.g., to protect business
secrets. On the opposite, this dataset provides these. The dataset comprises
120 photovoltaic and 273 wind power plants with distinct sides all over Germany

forecasting experiments to include spatial correlations and run experiments in
transfer and multi-task learning. It includes side-specific, power
source-dependent, non-synthetic input features from the ICON-EU weather model.
A simulation of virtual power plants with physical models and actual
meteorological measurements provides realistic synthetic power measurement time
series. These time series correspond to the power output of virtual power
plants at the location of the respective weather measurements. Since the
synthetic time series are based exclusively on weather measurements, possible
errors in the weather forecast are comparable to those in actual power data. In

And this has led to powerful algorithms for Early Classification of Time Series

events of different classes occur in a streaming fashion, with no predefined

is to predict events, i.e. their class and time interval, at the moment that
optimizes the accuracy vs. earliness trade-off. Interestingly, we find that
ECTS algorithms can be sensibly adapted in a principled way to this new

The lowest dimension of the state-space representation is given along with the

dynamics time series from different locations often have distinct patterns; and
for the same time series, patterns may vary across time, where, for example,
there exist certain periods across a day showing stronger temporal
correlations. Although recent forecasting models, in particular deep learning
based models, show promising results, they suffer from being spatio-temporal
agnostic. Such spatio-temporal agnostic models employ a shared parameter space
irrespective of the time series locations and the time periods and they assume
that the temporal patterns are similar across locations and do not evolve
across time, which may not always hold, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In
this work, we propose a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic
models to spatio-temporal aware models. To do so, we encode time series from
different locations into stochastic variables, from which we generate
location-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the
spatio-temporal dynamics. We show how to integrate the framework with canonical
attentions to enable spatio-temporal aware attentions. Next, to compensate for

reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, making spatio-temporal aware

We focus here on distributional and compositional time series. Applying a
square root transformation to the densities of the observations of a
distributional time series maps the distributional observations to the Hilbert
sphere, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric. Likewise, applying a square root
transformation to the components of the observations of a compositional time
series maps the compositional observations to a finite-dimensional sphere,
equipped with the geodesic metric on spheres. The challenge in modeling such

matrices and a collection of VAR coefficient matrices. To efficiently solve the
optimization problem, we derive an alternating minimization framework, in which
subproblems are solved using conjugate gradient and least squares methods. In
particular, the use of conjugate gradient method offers an efficient routine
and allows us to apply NoTMF on large-scale problems. Through extensive

(financial crises) can alternate with times of low variance (calm times). Here,
absolute values of time series terms are not white noise. We could test for
white noise separately for original and absolute values, for example using
Ljung-Box tests for both. In this article, we create an omnibus test which

answer three questions about the suitability of Deep Learning and Transfer
Learning to generate predictions of time series. Time series of M4 and M3

The proposed approach uses a novel contrastive loss that naturally exploits a
data augmentation scheme in which new samples are generated by mixing two data

adaptation suffer from inconsistencies in evaluation schemes, datasets, and
backbone neural network architectures. Moreover, labeled target data are often
used for model selection, which violates the fundamental assumption of
unsupervised domain adaptation. To address these issues, we develop a
benchmarking evaluation suite (AdaTime) to systematically and fairly evaluate
different domain adaptation methods on time series data. Specifically, we
standardize the backbone neural network architectures and benchmarking
datasets, while also exploring more realistic model selection approaches that
can work with no labeled data or just a few labeled samples. Our evaluation
includes adapting state-of-the-art visual domain adaptation methods to time
series data as well as the recent methods specifically developed for time

results suggest that with careful selection of hyper-parameters, visual domain
adaptation methods are competitive with methods proposed for time series domain
adaptation. In addition, we find that hyper-parameters could be selected based

structure and implies a different computational cost. However, it is not clear
why and when to use each RNN-cell structure. Actually, there is no
comprehensive characterization of all the possible time series behaviors and no
guidance on what RNN cell structure is the most suitable for each behavior. The
objective of this study is two-fold: it presents a comprehensive taxonomy of

time series behavior. We conducted two experiments: (1) The first experiment

creating 11 variants based on one alteration in its basic architecture

propose methodology for constructing identifying equations that can be used for

algorithm contains a reservoir matrix of N=19625 elements that must be filled

work investigates different methods of filling the reservoir with time series
(signal) elements. The reservoir filling method determines the accuracy of the
entropy estimation by convolution of the study time series and LogNNet test

series. Two of them (Method 3 and Method 6) employ the novel approach of
stretching the time series to create intermediate elements that complement it,

different time series data types (chaotic, periodic, and binary) with different
dynamic properties, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and offsets. The NNetEn
entropy calculation errors are less than 10% when SNR is greater than 30 dB,

automated method for determining the optimal MLP model architecture, thus
allowing for optimal prediction performance for the given time series. We
tested our approach by filling gaps of various lengths (three months to three
years) in three environmental datasets with different time series
characteristics, namely daily groundwater levels, daily soil moisture, and
hourly Net Ecosystem Exchange. We compared the accuracy of the gap-filled
values obtained with our approach to the widely-used R-based time series gap
filling methods ImputeTS and mtsdi. The results indicate that using an MLP for
filling a large gap leads to better results, especially when the data behave
nonlinearly. Thus, our approach enables the use of datasets that have a large
gap in one variable, which is common in many long-term environmental monitoring
observations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12441v1,cs.LG

decision-making processes due to its capability to quantify uncertainties. Deep
forecasting models, however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the
notion of such perturbations, together with that of robustness, has not even
been completely established in the regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this
work, we propose a framework for robust probabilistic time series forecasting.
First, we generalize the concept of adversarial input perturbations, based on
which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms of bounded Wasserstein
deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique to attain robust
probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates against
certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments
demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the
forecast quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency

sequential data such as time-series or video. Interpretability is defined as
the ability to be understood by a person and is different from explainability,
which is the ability to be explained in a mathematical formulation. A key
interpretability issue with RNNs is that it is not clear how each hidden state
per time step contributes to the decision-making process in a quantitative
manner. We propose NeuroView-RNN as a family of new RNN architectures that
explains how all the time steps are used for the decision-making process. Each
member of the family is derived from a standard RNN architecture by
concatenation of the hidden steps into a global linear classifier. The global
linear classifier has all the hidden states as the input, so the weights of the
classifier have a linear mapping to the hidden states. Hence, from the weights,
NeuroView-RNN can quantify how important each time step is to a particular
decision. As a bonus, NeuroView-RNN also offers higher accuracy in many cases

NeuroView-RNN by evaluating on a multitude of diverse time-series datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11811v1,cs.LG

environments is critical for online time series forecasting. Successful
solutions require handling changes to new and recurring patterns. However,
training deep neural forecaster on the fly is notoriously challenging because
of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and the
catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. In this work, inspired by the
Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning
Networks (FSNet), a holistic framework for online time-series forecasting to
simultaneously deal with abrupt changing and repeating patterns. Particularly,
FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast
adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet
achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two complementary components
of an adapter to monitor each layer's contribution to the lost, and an
associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating

forecasting, weather forecasting, traffic flow forecasting, and other fields.
Recently, some scholars have tried to apply Transformer to time series
forecasting because of its powerful parallel training ability. However, the
existing Transformer methods do not pay enough attention to the small time
segments that play a decisive role in prediction, making it insensitive to
small changes that affect the trend of time series, and it is difficult to
effectively learn continuous time-dependent features. To solve this problem, we
propose a differential attention fusion model based on Transformer, which
designs the differential layer, neighbor attention, sliding fusion mechanism,
and residual layer on the basis of classical Transformer architecture.
Specifically, the differences of adjacent time points are extracted and focused
by difference and neighbor attention. The sliding fusion mechanism fuses
various features of each time point so that the data can participate in
encoding and decoding without losing important information. The residual layer
including convolution and LSTM further learns the dependence between time
points and enables our model to carry out deeper training. A large number of

forecasting. However, most of these methods adopt the standard point-wise
self-attention mechanism, which not only becomes intractable for long-term
forecasting since its complexity increases quadratically with the length of
time series, but also cannot explicitly capture the predictive dependencies
from contexts since the corresponding key and value are transformed from the
same point. This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called
{\em Preformer}. Preformer introduces a novel efficient {\em Multi-Scale
Segment-Correlation} mechanism that divides time series into segments and
utilizes segment-wise correlation-based attention for encoding time series. A
multi-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different
temporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer
further designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value
come from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if
a key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its
successive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment.

confounder. In this work, we harness the expressive power of recurrent neural
networks and propose a deep learning-based approach to model non-linear Granger
causality by directly accounting for latent confounders. Our approach leverages
multiple recurrent neural networks to parameterise predictive distributions and
we propose the novel use of a dual-decoder setup to conduct the Granger tests.
We demonstrate the model performance on non-linear stochastic time series for

distribution shift problem, where their statistical properties change over

constantly-changing distribution shifts, which are common in time series. In
this paper, we propose Hyper Time- Series Forecasting (HTSF), a
hypernetwork-based framework for accurate time series forecasting under
distribution shift. HTSF jointly learns the time-varying distributions and the
corresponding forecasting models in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, HTSF
exploits the hyper layers to learn the best characterization of the
distribution shifts, generating the model parameters for the main layers to
make accurate predictions. We implement HTSF as an extensible framework that

is challenging because real-world time-series data exhibit complex temporal

effectively contains the nonlinear temporal dynamics of normal behavior. In
this study, we propose an unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly
detection model named RAE-MEPC which learns informative normal representations
based on multi-resolution ensemble and predictive coding. We introduce
multi-resolution ensemble encoding to capture the multi-scale dependency from
the input time series. The encoder hierarchically aggregates the temporal
features extracted from the sub-encoders with different encoding lengths. From
these encoded features, the reconstruction decoder reconstructs the input time
series based on multi-resolution ensemble decoding where lower-resolution
information helps to decode sub-decoders with higher-resolution outputs.
Predictive coding is further introduced to encourage the model to learn the

applied on top of a generic forecasting model, including deep learning

use of conformal predictors for time series by removing the requirement of data
exchangeability. The ensemble learners are implemented as generic machine
learning algorithms performing quantile regression, which allow the length of
the PIs to adapt to local variability in the data. In the experiments, we

explicitly captures both the temporal dependencies and feature correlations

Meanwhile, the weighted-combination design enables SAITS to dynamically assign

underlying patterns leads to discontinuous latent state trajectories and higher

complicate models with dedicated designs and redundant parameters, leading to
higher computational and memory overheads. (iii) Reliance on graph priors:
Relying on predefined static graph structures limits their effectiveness and

internal high-dimensional representation of MiniROCKET is well suited to be
complemented by the algebra of HDC. This leads to a more general formulation,
HDC-MiniROCKET, where the original algorithm is only a special case. We will
discuss and demonstrate that HDC-MiniROCKET can systematically overcome
catastrophic failures of MiniROCKET on simple synthetic datasets. These results

challenging problem because of its complex dynamics and sparse annotations.
Existing works mainly adopt the framework of contrastive learning with the
time-based augmentation techniques to sample positives and negatives for
contrastive training. Nevertheless, they mostly use segment-level augmentation
derived from time slicing, which may bring about sampling bias and incorrect
optimization with false negatives due to the loss of global context. Besides,
they all pay no attention to incorporate the spectral information in feature
representation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, namely Bilinear
Temporal-Spectral Fusion (BTSF). Specifically, we firstly utilize the
instance-level augmentation with a simple dropout on the entire time series for
maximally capturing long-term dependencies. We devise a novel iterative
bilinear temporal-spectral fusion to explicitly encode the affinities of
abundant time-frequency pairs, and iteratively refines representations in a
fusion-and-squeeze manner with Spectrum-to-Time (S2T) and Time-to-Spectrum
(T2S) Aggregation modules. We firstly conducts downstream evaluations on three
major tasks for time series including classification, forecasting and anomaly
detection. Experimental results shows that our BTSF consistently significantly

in time series analysis. It is more difficult to classify when time series of
the same class are not completely consistent in spectral domain or time series
of different classes are partly consistent in spectral domain. To address this
problem, we propose a novel method named Spectral Propagation Graph Network
(SPGN) to explicitly model and propagate the spectrum-wise relations between
different time series with graph network. To the best of our knowledge, SPGN is
the first to utilize spectral comparisons in different intervals and involve
spectral propagation across all time series with graph networks for few-shot
TSC. SPGN first uses bandpass filter to expand time series in spectral domain
for calculating spectrum-wise relations between time series. Equipped with
graph networks, SPGN then integrates spectral relations with label information
to make spectral propagation. The further study conveys the bi-directional
effect between spectral relations acquisition and spectral propagation. We
conduct extensive experiments on few-shot TSC benchmarks. SPGN outperforms
state-of-the-art results by a large margin in $4\% \sim 13\%$. Moreover, SPGN

challenge as it requires simultaneous representation of long term temporal
dependencies and correlations across multiple variables. More often, this is
solved by breaking the complexity through modeling one dependency at a time. In
this paper, we propose a Time-series Representational Learning through
Contrastive Predictive Coding (TRL-CPC) towards anomaly detection in MVTS data.
First, we jointly optimize an encoder, an auto-regressor and a non-linear
transformation function to effectively learn the representations of the MVTS
data sets, for predicting future trends. It must be noted that the context
vectors are representative of the observation window in the MTVS. Next, the
latent representations for the succeeding instants obtained through non-linear
transformations of these context vectors, are contrasted with the latent
representations of the encoder for the multi-variables such that the density
for the positive pair is maximized. Thus, the TRL-CPC helps to model the
temporal dependencies and the correlations of the parameters for a healthy
signal pattern. Finally, fitting the latent representations are fit into a
Gaussian scoring function to detect anomalies. Evaluation of the proposed
TRL-CPC on three MVTS data sets against SOTA anomaly detection methods shows
the superiority of TRL-CPC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03639v1,cs.LG

applications in many domains (medical, geoscience, network analysis, finance,
econometry etc.). In the case of multivariate time series, the key to good
performances is to properly capture the dependencies between the variates.
Often, these variates are structured, i.e. they are localised in an abstract
space, usually representing an aspect of the physical world, and prediction
amounts to a form of diffusion of the information across that space over time.
Several neural network models of diffusion have been proposed in the
literature. However, most of the existing proposals rely on some a priori
knowledge on the structure of the space, usually in the form of a graph
weighing the pairwise diffusion capacity of its points. We argue that this
piece of information can often be dispensed with, since data already contains
the diffusion capacity information, and in a more reliable form than that
obtained from the usually largely hand-crafted graphs. We propose instead a
fully data-driven model which does not rely on such a graph, nor any other
prior structural information. We conduct a first set of experiments to measure
the impact on performance of a structural prior, as used in baseline models,
and show that, except at very low data levels, it remains negligible, and
beyond a threshold, it may even become detrimental. We then investigate,
through a second set of experiments, the capacity of our model in two respects:
treatment of missing data and domain adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03539v1,cs.LG

propose a versatile method, based on the transformer architecture, that
estimates joint distributions using an attention-based decoder that provably
learns to mimic the properties of non-parametric copulas. The resulting model
has several desirable properties: it can scale to hundreds of time series,
supports both forecasting and interpolation, can handle unaligned and

perspective on forecasting spatial environmental data collected sequentially
over time. We treat this data set as a surface (functional) time series with a
possibly complicated geographical domain. By employing novel techniques from
functional data analysis we develop a new forecasting methodology. Our approach
consists of two steps. In the first step, time series of surfaces are
reconstructed from measurements sampled over some spatial domain using a finite
element spline smoother. In the second step, we adapt the dynamic functional
factor model to forecast a surface time series. The advantage of this approach
is that we can account for and explore simultaneously spatial as well as

anomaly detection for time-series data (RADTD), which can automatically learn
dynamical features in time series and recognize anomalies with low label

maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool.
RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long
sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these

generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length,
similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the

supervised learning for forecasting -- their distributions evolve over time,

In this paper, we propose a novel method, Self-Adaptive Forecasting (SAF), to
modify the training of time-series forecasting models to improve their
performance on forecasting tasks with such non-stationary time-series data. SAF
integrates a self-adaptation stage prior to forecasting based on `backcasting',
i.e. predicting masked inputs backward in time. This is a form of test-time
training that creates a self-supervised learning problem on test samples before
performing the prediction task. In this way, our method enables efficient
adaptation of encoded representations to evolving distributions, leading to
superior generalization. SAF can be integrated with any canonical
encoder-decoder based time-series architecture such as recurrent neural
networks or attention-based architectures. On synthetic and real-world datasets
in domains where time-series data are known to be notoriously non-stationary,
such as healthcare and finance, we demonstrate a significant benefit of SAF in
improving forecasting accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02403v3,cs.LG

representations for the global and local factors of variation in time series.
The local representation of each sample models non-stationarity over time with
a stochastic process prior, and the global representation of the sample encodes
the time-independent characteristics. To encourage decoupling between the
representations, we introduce counterfactual regularization that minimizes the
mutual information between the two variables. In experiments, we demonstrate
successful recovery of the true local and global variability factors on

such a paradigm from a causal perspective. Following this principle, we propose
a new time series representation learning framework for time series forecasting

partial correlation, graphical models and autoregressive representations are
encoded in the inverse of its spectral density matrix. This is not true for
nonstationary time series, where the pertinent information lies in the inverse
infinite dimensional covariance matrix operator associated with the
multivariate time series. This necessitates the study of the covariance of a
multivariate nonstationary time series and its relationship to its inverse. We
show that if the rows/columns of the infinite dimensional covariance matrix
decay at a certain rate then the rate (up to a factor) transfers to the
rows/columns of the inverse covariance matrix. This is used to obtain a
nonstationary autoregressive representation of the time series and a
Baxter-type bound between the parameters of the autoregressive infinite
representation and the corresponding finite autoregressive projection. The
aforementioned results lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis of
locally stationary time series. In particular, we show that smoothness

networks. It is often the case that input time-series data have only one
realized (and usually irregularly sampled) path, which makes it difficult to
extract time-series characteristics, and its noise structure is more
complicated than i.i.d. type. Time series data, especially from hydrology,
telecommunications, economics, and finance, exhibit long-term memory also
called long-range dependency (LRD). The main purpose of this paper is to
artificially generate time series with the help of neural networks, making the
LRD of paths into account. We propose fSDE-Net: neural fractional Stochastic
Differential Equation Network. It generalizes the neural stochastic
differential equation model by using fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst
index larger than half, which exhibits the LRD property. We derive the solver
of fSDE-Net and theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the

temporal data, allowing for the efficient storage of and information retrieval
from time series. They can also enhance the training of machine learning
algorithms on time series data through noise reduction and reduced sensitivity
to hyperparameters. The adaptive Brownian bridge-based aggregation (ABBA)
method is one such effective and robust symbolic representation, demonstrated
to accurately capture important trends and shapes in time series. However, in
its current form the method struggles to process very large time series. Here
we present a new variant of the ABBA method, called fABBA. This variant
utilizes a new aggregation approach tailored to the piecewise representation of
time series. By replacing the k-means clustering used in ABBA with a
sorting-based aggregation technique, and thereby avoiding repeated
sum-of-squares error computations, the computational complexity is
significantly reduced. In contrast to the original method, the new approach
does not require the number of time series symbols to be specified in advance.
Through extensive tests we demonstrate that the new method significantly
outperforms ABBA with a considerable reduction in runtime while also
outperforming the popular SAX and 1d-SAX representations in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. We further demonstrate that fABBA can compress other

of constructing an irregular time series that is uniform across every sample in
a data set. Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of
non-overlapping bins (dubbed ""slices"") of observation times and ensure that
each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows
one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series
classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute
individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known
class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest
neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing
features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional
uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder
long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and
classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After
illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same

scalable self-supervised model for time series generation. ExtraMAE randomly
masks some patches of the original time series and learns temporal dynamics by

ExtraMAE is self-supervised. Supervision allows ExtraMAE to effectively and
efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the original time series. Second,
ExtraMAE proposes an extrapolator to disentangle two jobs of the decoder:
recovering latent representations and mapping them back into the feature space.
These unique designs enable ExtraMAE to consistently and significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) benchmarks in time series generation. The
lightweight architecture also makes ExtraMAE fast and scalable. ExtraMAE shows
outstanding behavior in various downstream tasks such as time series
classification, prediction, and imputation. As a self-supervised generative

LSTM encoder and challenged by more complex data consisting of time series in
the form of spring oscillations. The model showed promise, and was able to
reconstruct true trajectories for all complexities of data with a smaller RMSE

based changepoints in spatially correlated functional time series. Unlike
previous methods that assume a shared changepoint at all spatial locations or
ignore spatial correlation, our method treats changepoints as a spatial
process. This allows our model to respect spatial heterogeneity and exploit
spatial correlations to improve estimation. Our method is derived from the
ubiquitous cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic that dominates changepoint
detection in functional time series. However, instead of directly searching for
the maximum of the CUSUM based processes, we build spatially correlated
two-piece linear models with appropriate variance structure to locate all
changepoints at once. The proposed linear model approach increases the
robustness of our method to variability in the CUSUM process, which, combined
with our spatial correlation model, improves changepoint estimation near the
edges. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that our method
outperforms existing functional changepoint estimators in terms of both
estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification, under either weak and
strong spatial correlation, and weak and strong change signals. Finally, we

irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly

sales time series analytics. In contrast to supervised machine learning which
is a kind of passive learning using historical data, Q-learning is a kind of
active learning with goal to maximize a reward by optimal sequence of actions.
Model free Q-learning approach for optimal pricing strategies and supply-demand

using deep Q-learning approach in time series analytics, the sequence of
actions can be optimized by maximizing the reward function when the environment
for learning agent interaction can be modeled using the parametric model and in
the case of using the model which is based on the historical data. In the

study, the environment was modeled using sales dependence on extra price and
randomly simulated demand. In the supply-demand case study, it was proposed to
use historical demand time series for environment modeling, agent states were
represented by promo actions, previous demand values and weekly seasonality
features. Obtained results show that using deep Q-learning, we can optimize the

data mining. Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)
similarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest
neighbors, and (2) deep learning models that directly learn the representations
for classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working
mechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a
way as to jointly model time-series similarities and learn the representations.
This is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently
leverage similarity information. To tackle the challenge, we propose
Similarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and
general framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks
(GNNs). Specifically, we formulate TSC as a node classification problem in
graphs, where the nodes correspond to time-series, and the links correspond to
pair-wise similarities. We further design a graph construction strategy and a
batch training algorithm with negative sampling to improve training efficiency.
We instantiate SimTSC with ResNet as the backbone and Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) as the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on the full UCR datasets

incorporating similarity information into deep learning models in both

been proposed to generate compact similarity-preserving representations of time
series, enabling real-time similarity search on large in-memory data
collections. However, the existing techniques are not ideally suited for
assessing similarity when sequences are locally out of phase. In this paper, we
propose the use of product quantization for efficient similarity-based
comparison of time series under time warping. The idea is to first compress the
data by partitioning the time series into equal length sub-sequences which are
represented by a short code. The distance between two time series can then be
efficiently approximated by pre-computed elastic distances between their codes.
The partitioning into sub-sequences forces unwanted alignments, which we
address with a pre-alignment step using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT). To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we
perform an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets in nearest
neighbors classification and clustering applications. Overall, the proposed
solution emerges as a highly efficient (both in terms of memory usage and

multiple countries could lead to improvements in long-term forecasting. Data
fed into joint models are often grouped according to nominal attributes, such
as geographic regions, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status, which may still

a novel clustering technique to pursue homogeneity among multiple functional
time series based on functional panel data modelling to address this issue.
Using a functional panel data model with fixed effects, we can extract common
functional time series features. These common features could be decomposed into
two components: the functional time trend and the mode of variations of
functions (functional pattern). The functional time trend reflects the dynamics
across time, while the functional pattern captures the fluctuations within
curves. The proposed clustering method searches for homogeneous age-specific
mortality rates of multiple countries by accounting for both the modes of
variations and the temporal dynamics among curves. We demonstrate that the
proposed clustering technique outperforms other existing methods through a
Monte Carlo simulation and could handle complicated cases with slow decaying
eigenvalues. In empirical data analysis, we find that the clustering results of
age-specific mortality rates can be explained by the combination of geographic

modeling it via graph structures, along with the sequential (time series)

continuous sensor data recording results in datasets which are big in size and
volume, which are challenging to process and analyze with traditional
techniques in a timely manner. Such collected sensor data is typically
extracted in the form of time series data. There are two main approaches in the
literature, namely, shape-based classification and feature-based
classification. Shape-based classification determines the best class according
to a distance measure. Feature-based classification, on the other hand,
measures properties of the time series and finds the best class according to
the set of features defined for the time series. In this dissertation, we

an aggregation hierarchy. Different types of forecasting models can be employed
as individual ``experts'' so that each model is tailored to the nature of the
corresponding time series. \texttt{DYCHEM} learns hierarchical structures
during the training stage to help generalize better across all the time series
being modeled and also mitigates coherency issues that arise due to constraints
imposed by the hierarchy. To improve the reliability of forecasts, we construct
quantile estimations based on the point forecasts obtained from combined
heterogeneous models. The resulting quantile forecasts are coherent and
independent of the choice of forecasting models. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of both point and quantile forecasts for hierarchical time series
(HTS), including public data and user records from a large financial software

cyber-physical systems, where multiple sensors emit time series that capture
interconnected processes. Solutions based on deep learning that deliver
state-of-the-art CTS forecasting performance employ a variety of
spatio-temporal (ST) blocks that are able to model temporal dependencies and
spatial correlations among time series. However, two challenges remain. First,
ST-blocks are designed manually, which is time consuming and costly. Second,
existing forecasting models simply stack the same ST-blocks multiple times,
which limits the model potential. To address these challenges, we propose
AutoCTS that is able to automatically identify highly competitive ST-blocks as
well as forecasting models with heterogeneous ST-blocks connected using diverse
topologies, as opposed to the same ST-blocks connected using simple stacking.
Specifically, we design both a micro and a macro search space to model possible
architectures of ST-blocks and the connections among heterogeneous ST-blocks,
and we provide a search strategy that is able to jointly explore the search
spaces to identify optimal forecasting models. Extensive experiments on eight
commonly used CTS forecasting benchmark datasets justify our design choices and
demonstrate that AutoCTS is capable of automatically discovering forecasting
models that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed models. This is an

We introduce the causal tail coefficient for time series, which can identify
asymmetrical causal relations between extreme events under certain assumptions.
This method can handle nonlinear relations and latent variables. Moreover, we

finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control in variable selection in

works have focused on the setting of independent and identically distributed
observations. Yet time series data is prevalent in practical applications in
various fields such as economics and social sciences. This motivates the study
of model-X knockoffs inference for time series data. In this paper, we make
some initial attempt to establish the theoretical and methodological foundation
for the model-X knockoffs inference for time series data. We suggest the method
of time series knockoffs inference (TSKI) by exploiting the ideas of
subsampling and e-values to address the difficulty caused by the serial
dependence. We also generalize the robust knockoffs inference to the time
series setting and relax the assumption of known covariate distribution
required by model-X knockoffs, because such an assumption is overly stringent
for time series data. We establish sufficient conditions under which TSKI
achieves the asymptotic FDR control. Our technical analysis reveals the effects
of serial dependence and unknown covariate distribution on the FDR control. We
conduct power analysis of TSKI using the Lasso coefficient difference knockoff

evaluate multiple methods and choose one of these methods or an ensemble for
producing the best forecasts. However, choosing among different ensembles over
multiple methods remains a challenging task that undergoes a combinatorial
explosion as the number of methods increases. In the context of demand
forecasting or revenue forecasting, this challenge is further exacerbated by a
large number of time series as well as limited historical data points available
due to changing business context. Although deep learning forecasting methods
aim to simultaneously forecast large collections of time series, they become
challenging to apply in such scenarios due to the limited history available and
might not yield desirable results. We propose a framework for forecasting short
high-dimensional time series data by combining low-rank temporal matrix
factorization and optimal model selection on latent time series using
cross-validation. We demonstrate that forecasting the latent factors leads to
significant performance gains as compared to directly applying different
uni-variate models on time series. Performance has been validated on a
truncated version of the M4 monthly dataset which contains time series data

applications, e.g., fraud detection in finance and healthcare monitoring. Due
to the inherently unpredictable and highly varied nature of anomalies and the
lack of anomaly labels in historical data, the AD problem is typically

solutions is often not satisfactory, especially in data-scarce scenarios. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised learning technique for
AD in time series, namely \emph{DeepFIB}. We model the problem as a \emph{Fill

the rest. Considering the two common anomaly shapes (point- or
sequence-outliers) in TS data, we implement two masking strategies with many
self-generated training samples. The corresponding self-imputation networks can
extract more robust temporal relations than existing AD solutions and
effectively facilitate identifying the two types of anomalies. For continuous
outliers, we also propose an anomaly localization algorithm that dramatically
reduces AD errors. Experiments on various real-world TS datasets demonstrate

applied to time series, confidence intervals are computed for each time point
separately. Alternatively, we can compute confidence bands, where we are
required to find the smallest area enveloping $k$ time series, where $k$ is a
user parameter. Confidence bands can be then used to detect abnormal time
series, not just individual observations within the time series. We will show
that despite being an NP-hard problem it is possible to find optimal confidence
band for some $k$. We do this by considering a different problem: discovering
regularized bands, where we minimize the envelope area minus the number of
included time series weighted by a parameter $\alpha$. Unlike normal confidence
bands we can solve the problem exactly by using a minimum cut. By varying
$\alpha$ we can obtain solutions for various $k$. If we have a constraint $k$
for which we cannot find appropriate $\alpha$, we demonstrate a simple
algorithm that yields $O(\sqrt{n})$ approximation guarantee by connecting the
problem to a minimum $k$-union problem. This connection also implies that we
cannot approximate the problem better than $O(n^{1/4})$ under some (mild)
assumptions. Finally, we consider a variant where instead of minimizing the
area we minimize the maximum width. Here, we demonstrate a simple
2-approximation algorithm and show that we cannot achieve better approximation

requiring methods that account for continuous and abrupt changes of sampling
resolution without introducing additional biases. The edit-distance is an
effective metric to quantitatively compare time series segments of unequal

show that transformation costs generally exhibit a non-trivial relationship
with local sampling rate. If the sampling resolution undergoes strong
variations, this effect impedes unbiased comparison between different time
episodes. We study the impact of this effect on recurrence quantification
analysis, a framework that is well-suited for identifying regime shifts in
nonlinear time series. A constrained randomization approach is put forward to
correct for the biased recurrence quantification measures. This strategy
involves the generation of a novel type of time series and time axis surrogates

effectiveness of the proposed approach with a synthetic example and an
irregularly sampled speleothem proxy record from Niue island in the central

strictly exogenous regressors. Our result is then extended to some infinite

autoregressive models for which the covariates are sequentially exogenous.
Using a general random mapping approach on finite sets, we get explicit mixing

structures such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU were proposed to model the fault
diagnosis effectively. However, these models are restricted by their serial

parallel CNN is difficult to implement fault diagnosis in an efficient way
because it requires larger convolution kernels or deep structure to achieve
long-term feature extraction capabilities. Besides, BERT model applies absolute
position embedding to introduce contextual information to the model, which
would bring noise to the raw data and therefore cannot be applied to fault
diagnosis directly. In order to address the above problems, a fault diagnosis

of the main challenges of modern time series analysis. In this paper, we show
that every uniformly-positive-definite-in-covariance and sufficiently
short-range dependent non-stationary and nonlinear time series can be well
approximated globally by a white-noise-driven auto-regressive (AR) process of
slowly diverging order. To our best knowledge, it is the first time such a
structural approximation result is established for general classes of
non-stationary time series. A high dimensional $\mathcal{L}^2$ test and an
associated multiplier bootstrap procedure are proposed for the inference of the
AR approximation coefficients. In particular, an adaptive stability test is
proposed to check whether the AR approximation coefficients are time-varying, a
frequently-encountered question for practitioners and researchers of time
series. As an application, globally optimal short-term forecasting theory and
methodology for a wide class of locally stationary time series are established

dimension and capture temporal dependence simultaneously. A factor-based
bootstrap procedure is constructed, which conducts AR-sieve bootstrap on the
extracted low-dimensional common factor time series and then recovers the
bootstrap samples for original data from the factor model. Asymptotic
properties for bootstrap mean statistics and extreme eigenvalues are
established. Various simulations further demonstrate the advantages of the new

shift problem for visual applications. Yet, these approaches may have limited
performance for time series data due to the following reasons. First, they
mainly rely on large-scale dataset (i.e., ImageNet) for the source pretraining,
which is not applicable for time-series data. Second, they ignore the temporal
dimension on the feature space of the source and target domains during the
domain alignment step. Last, most of prior UDA methods can only align the
global features without considering the fine-grained class distribution of the
target domain. To address these limitations, we propose a Self-supervised
Autoregressive Domain Adaptation (SLARDA) framework. In particular, we first
design a self-supervised learning module that utilizes forecasting as an
auxiliary task to improve the transferability of the source features. Second,
we propose a novel autoregressive domain adaptation technique that incorporates
temporal dependency of both source and target features during domain alignment.
Finally, we develop an ensemble teacher model to align the class-wise
distribution in the target domain via a confident pseudo labeling approach.

minimize the cost of non-linear alignments between series. CDTW and WDTW have
been introduced because DTW is too permissive in its alignments. However, CDTW
uses a crude step function, allowing unconstrained flexibility within the
window, and none beyond it. WDTW's multiplicative weight is relative to the
distances between aligned points along a warped path, rather than being a
direct function of the amount of warping that is introduced. In this paper, we
introduce Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW), a new, intuitive, DTW variant
that penalizes the act of warping by a fixed additive cost. Like CDTW and WDTW,
ADTW constrains the amount of warping. However, it avoids both abrupt
discontinuities in the amount of warping allowed and the limitations of a
multiplicative penalty. We formally introduce ADTW, prove some of its

correlation in daily maximum temperature forecast errors for 111 cities spread

uncovers interpretable regional spatial effects, and captures the higher
variance observed in inland cities versus coastal cities, as well as the higher
variance observed in mountain and midwest states. The functional approach also
naturally handles missing data through modelling a continuum, and can be
implemented efficiently by exploiting the sparsity induced by a B-spline basis.
  The temporal dependence in the data is modeled through temporal dependence in
functional basis coefficients. Independent first order autoregressions with
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity [AR(1)+GARCH(1,1)]

local temporal patterns, respectively, and a decoder to make multi-step
forecasting. Specifically, to model complicated global patterns, the vector
quantization (VQ) module is introduced, allowing the global feature encoder to
learn a shared codebook among all time series. To model diversified and
heterogenous local patterns, an adaptive parameter generation module enhanced
by the contrastive multi-horizon coding (CMC) is proposed to generate the
parameters of the local feature encoder for each individual time series, which
maximizes the mutual information between the series-specific context variable
and the long/short-term representations of the corresponding time series. Our
experiments on several real-world datasets show that DeepDGL outperforms

time-series forecasting, which is underexplored in literatures, despite being
often encountered in practice. Existing methods on time-series domain
adaptation mainly follow the paradigm designed for the static data, which
cannot handle domain-specific complex conditional dependencies raised by data
offset, time lags, and variant data distributions. In order to address these
challenges, we analyze variational conditional dependencies in time-series data
and find that the causal structures are usually stable among domains, and
further raise the causal conditional shift assumption. Enlightened by this
assumption, we consider the causal generation process for time-series data and
propose an end-to-end model for the semi-supervised domain adaptation problem
on time-series forecasting. Our method can not only discover the Granger-Causal
structures among cross-domain data but also address the cross-domain
time-series forecasting problem with accurate and interpretable predicted
results. We further theoretically analyze the superiority of the proposed
method, where the generalization error on the target domain is bounded by the
empirical risks and by the discrepancy between the causal structures from
different domains. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data

a result, generating continuous medical time series is a very critical research
area. Several research works already showed that the ability of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) in the case of continuous medical time series
generation is promising. Most medical data generation works, such as ECG

squared modulus of the frequency response of the filter generating the effect.
Since SIC rests on methods and assumptions in stark contrast with most causal
discovery methods for time series, it raises questions regarding what
theoretical grounds justify its use. In this paper, we provide answers covering
several key aspects. After providing an information theoretic interpretation of
SIC, we present an identifiability result that sheds light on the context for
which this approach is expected to perform well. We further demonstrate the
robustness of SIC to downsampling - an obstacle that can spoil Granger-based

this privileged data leads to more sample-efficient learning of models that use
only baseline data for predictions at test time. We give an algorithm for this
setting and prove that when the time series are drawn from a non-stationary
Gaussian-linear dynamical system of fixed horizon, learning with privileged
information is more efficient than learning without it. On synthetic data, we
test the limits of our algorithm and theory, both when our assumptions hold and

transformation operator that provides distributional flexibility and a rounding
operator that ensures the correct support for the discrete data-generating
process. We develop conjugate inference for the warped DLM, which enables
analytic and recursive updates for the state space filtering and smoothing
distributions. We leverage these results to produce customized and efficient
algorithms for inference and forecasting, including Monte Carlo simulation for
offline analysis and an optimal particle filter for online inference. This
framework unifies and extends a variety of discrete time series models and is
valid for natural counts, rounded values, and multivariate observations.

represented by a set of discrete realizations known as scenarios. A popular
scenario generation approach uses deep generative models (DGM) that allow
scenario generation without prior assumptions about the data distribution.
However, the validation of generated scenarios is difficult, and a
comprehensive discussion about appropriate validation methods is currently
lacking. To start this discussion, we provide a critical assessment of the
currently used validation methods in the energy scenario generation literature.
In particular, we assess validation methods based on probability density,
auto-correlation, and power spectral density. Furthermore, we propose using the
multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) as an additional validation
method for non-trivial features like peaks, bursts, and plateaus. As
representative examples, we train generative adversarial networks (GANs),
Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) on two renewable
power generation time series (photovoltaic and wind from Germany in 2013 to

Exchange in 2017 to 2019. We apply the four validation methods to both the
historical and the generated data and discuss the interpretation of validation
results as well as common mistakes, pitfalls, and limitations of the validation

microscopic time series follow some unknown mixture probabilistic
distributions. We theoretically show that as we identify the ground truth
latent mixture components, the estimation of time series from each component

series by handling every time series separately, GACAN combines the outcome of
processing all time series after each graph attention layer. Thus, the effects
of different time granularities are integrated throughout the model. We perform

probabilistic forecasts for time series when reliable hierarchical information

construction, the model guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple
rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the predictive distributions. We
perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other

well understood in terms of their causal structure without additional domain
knowledge about the system. Especially when analyzing observational time series
data of dynamical systems where it is not possible to conduct controlled
experiments, for example time series of climate variables, it can be
challenging to determine how features causally influence each other. There are
many techniques available to recover causal relationships from data, such as
Granger causality, convergent cross mapping, and causal graph structure
learning approaches such as PCMCI. Path signatures and their associated signed
areas provide a new way to approach the analysis of causally linked dynamical
systems, particularly in informing a model-free, data-driven approach to
algorithmic causal discovery. With this paper, we explore the use of path
signatures in causal discovery and propose the application of confidence
sequences to analyze the significance of the magnitude of the signed area
between two variables. These confidence sequence regions converge with greater
sampling length, and in conjunction with analyzing pairwise signed areas across
time-shifted versions of the time series, can help identify the presence of
lag/lead causal relationships. This approach provides a new way to define the
confidence of a causal link existing between two time series, and ultimately
may provide a framework for hypothesis testing to define whether one time
series causes another",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12288v1,stat.ML

to the availability of software for feature extraction. Feature-based
time-series analysis can now be performed using many different feature sets,
including hctsa (7730 features: Matlab), feasts (42 features: R), tsfeatures
(63 features: R), Kats (40 features: Python), tsfresh (up to 1558 features:
Python), TSFEL (390 features: Python), and the C-coded catch22 (22 features:
Matlab, R, Python, and Julia). There is substantial overlap in the types of
methods included in these sets (e.g., properties of the autocorrelation
function and Fourier power spectrum), but they are yet to be systematically
compared. Here we compare these seven sets on computational speed, assess the
redundancy of features contained in each, and evaluate the overlap and
redundancy between them. We take an empirical approach to feature similarity
based on outputs across a diverse set of real-world and simulated time series.
We find that feature sets vary across three orders of magnitude in their
computation time per feature on a laptop for a 1000-sample series, from the
fastest sets catch22 and TSFEL (~0.1ms per feature) to tsfeatures (~3s per
feature). Using PCA to evaluate feature redundancy within each set, we find the
highest within-set redundancy for TSFEL and tsfresh. For example, in TSFEL, 90%
of the variance across 390 features can be captured with just four PCs.
Finally, we introduce a metric for quantifying overlap between pairs of feature
sets, which indicates substantial overlap. We found that the largest feature
set, hctsa, is the most comprehensive, and that tsfresh is the most
distinctive, due to its incorporation of many low-level Fourier coefficients.
Our results provide empirical understanding of the differences between existing
feature sets, information that can be used to better tailor feature sets to
their applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10914v1,cs.LG

forecasting strategies: Direct Forecasting and Iterative Forecasting, where the
former provides low bias, high variance forecasts and the later leads to low
variance, high bias forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting
strategy called Generative Forecasting (GenF), which generates synthetic data
for the next few time steps and then makes long-range forecasts based on
generated and observed data. We theoretically prove that GenF is able to better
balance the forecasting variance and bias, leading to a much smaller
forecasting error. We implement GenF via three components: (i) a novel
conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator
for synthetic time series data generation, called CWGAN-TS. (ii) a transformer
based predictor, which makes long-range predictions using both generated and
observed data. (iii) an information theoretic clustering algorithm to improve
the training of both the CWGAN-TS and the transformer based predictor. The
experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that GenF
significantly outperforms a diverse range of state-of-the-art benchmarks and
classical approaches. Specifically, we find a 5% - 11% improvement in
predictive performance (mean absolute error) while having a 15% - 50% reduction

continues a challenging problem due to the increased scale of dimensions and
complexity of today's IT monitoring systems. Recent progress of unsupervised
time-series anomaly detection mainly use deep autoencoders to solve this
problem, i.e. training on normal samples and producing significant
reconstruction error on abnormal inputs. However, in practice, autoencoders can
reconstruct anomalies so well, due to powerful capabilites of neural networks.
Besides, these approaches can be ineffective for identifying non-point
anomalies, e.g. contextual anomalies and collective anomalies, since they
solely utilze a point-wise reconstruction objective. To tackle the above
issues, we propose MemAAE (\textit{Memory-augmented Adversarial Autoencoders

detection method for time-series. By jointly training two complementary proxy
tasks, reconstruction and prediction, with a shared network architecture, we
show that detecting anomalies via multiple tasks obtains superior performance
rather than single-task training. Additionally, a compressive memory module is
introduced to preserve normal patterns, avoiding unexpected generalization on
abnormal inputs. Through extensive experiments, MemAAE achieves an overall F1

time series of noisy information about the spread. Initially, there is a single
vertex affected by the cascade (the source) and the cascade spreads in discrete
time steps across the network. The cascade evolution is hidden, but one can
observe a time series of noisy signals from each vertex. The time series of a
vertex is assumed to be a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a pre-change
distribution $Q_0$ before the cascade affects the vertex, and the time series
is a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a post-change distribution $Q_1$ once the
cascade has affected the vertex. Given the time series of noisy signals, which
can be viewed as a noisy measurement of the cascade evolution, we aim to devise
a procedure to reliably estimate the cascade source as fast as possible.
  We investigate Bayesian and minimax formulations of the source estimation
problem, and derive near-optimal estimators for simple cascade dynamics and
network topologies. In the Bayesian setting, an estimator which observes
samples until the error of the Bayes-optimal estimator falls below a threshold
achieves optimal performance. In the minimax setting, optimal performance is
achieved by designing a novel multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio
test (MSPRT). We find that these optimal estimators require $\log \log n / \log
(k - 1)$ observations of the noisy time series when the network topology is a
$k$-regular tree, and $(\log n)^{\frac{1}{\ell + 1}}$ observations are required
for $\ell$-dimensional lattices. Finally, we discuss how our methods may be
extended to cascades on arbitrary graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08115v2,math.ST

heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important
information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device
malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on

consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set
of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in
practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying
sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic).
Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel
semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network
time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of
network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the
limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal
and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training

these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach for
modeling human behavior (named, MTpattern) from time-series data. For mining
frequent human behavior patterns effectively, we utilize a three-stage
pipeline: (1) represent time series data into a sequence of regularly sampled
equal-sized unit time intervals for better analysis, (2) a new distance measure
scheme is proposed to cluster similar sequences which can handle temporal
variation and uncertainty in the data, and (3) exploit an exemplar-based
clustering mechanism and fine-tune its parameters to output minimum number of
clusters with given permissible distance constraints and without knowing the
number of modes present in the data. Then, the average of all sequences in a

updated data whenever the models accuracy is observed to degrade. However,
these methods rely on near real time availability of ground truth, which is
rarely fulfilled. Further, in applications with seasonal data, temporal concept
drift is confounded by seasonal variation. In this work, we propose an approach

this work we aim for causal discovery in a more general class of scenarios,
scenes with non-stationary behavior over time. For our purposes we here regard
a scene as a composition objects interacting with each other over time.
Non-stationarity is modeled as stationarity conditioned on an underlying
variable, a state, which can be of varying dimension, more or less hidden given
observations of the scene, and also depend more or less directly on these
observations. We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach called
State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI) for causal discovery in such

networks can be organized as multivariate time series with additional spatial
attributes. A crucial task in analyzing such data is to identify and detect
anomalous observations and events from the data with complex spatial and
temporal dependencies. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a widely
used tool for anomaly detection. However, the traditional RPCA purely relies on
the global low-rank assumption while ignoring the local temporal correlations.
In light of this, this study proposes a Hankel-structured tensor version of
RPCA for anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data. We treat the raw data with
anomalies as a multivariate time series matrix (location $\times$ time) and
assume the denoised matrix has a low-rank structure. Then we transform the
low-rank matrix to a third-order tensor by applying temporal Hankelization. In
the end, we decompose the corrupted matrix into a low-rank Hankel tensor and a
sparse matrix. With the Hankelization operation, the model can simultaneously
capture the global and local spatiotemporal correlations and exhibit more
robust performance. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem and use
tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to approximate the tensor rank and $l_1$ norm to
approximate the sparsity. We develop an efficient solution algorithm based on
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Despite having three
hyper-parameters, the model is easy to set in practice. We evaluate the

problem, which requires the model to derive a distinguishable criterion.
Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise

power in unified modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association,
and we find that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can
embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due
to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difficult to build nontrivial
associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies'
associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This
adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently
distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through
the \emph{Association Discrepancy}. Technically, we propose the \emph{Anomaly

machine learning performance in data-rich (target) domains where ground truth
labels are inaccessible but can be found in related (source) domains. In cases
where meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak
supervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA,
to tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of
contrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source
UDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes
adversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike
prior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information
across domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other,
while pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through
contrastive learning. Unlike prior contrastive adaptation methods, CALDA
requires neither data augmentation nor pseudo labeling, which may be more
challenging for time series. We empirically validate our proposed approach.
Based on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and
synthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves
performance over prior time series and contrastive methods. Weak supervision
further improves performance, even in the presence of noise, allowing CALDA to

similarity allows for measures of similarity that are more robust to noise and
partial occlusions of the relevant signals. Our proposed measure kdiff is a

LSTM-Fully Convolutional Networks (ALSTM-FCN). The proposed layers
significantly improve each of these models with minimally increased network

convolutions with OctConv, we significantly improve accuracy for time series
classification tasks for most of the benchmark datasets. In addition, the
updated ALSTM-OctFCN performs statistically the same as the top two time series

proposed recently, but a systematic comparison on a common set of datasets and
metrics is lacking. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive
evaluation of unsupervised and semi-supervised deep-learning based methods for
anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from
cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and
post-processing of model errors, i.e. the scoring functions independently of
each other, through a grid of 10 models and 4 scoring functions, comparing
these variants to state of the art methods. In time-series anomaly detection,
detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual
anomalous time-points. Through experiments, we find that the existing
evaluation metrics either do not take events into account, or cannot
distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or
an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks,
namely, the composite F-score ($Fc_1$), for evaluating time-series anomaly
detection.
  Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than
static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of
scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model.
We also find that a simple, channel-wise model - the Univariate Fully-Connected
Auto-Encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning

of view of generating processes are proposed. The procedures are robust
versions of a fuzzy C-means model based on: (i) estimates of the quantile
cross-spectral density and (ii) the classical principal component analysis.
Robustness to the presence of outliers is achieved by using the so-called
metric, noise and trimmed approaches. The metric approach incorporates in the
objective function a distance measure aimed at neutralizing the effect of the
outliers, the noise approach builds an artificial cluster expected to contain
the outlying series and the trimmed approach eliminates the most atypical
series in the dataset. All the proposed techniques inherit the nice properties
of the quantile cross-spectral density, as being able to uncover general types
of dependence. Results from a broad simulation study including multivariate
linear, nonlinear and GARCH processes indicate that the algorithms are
substantially effective in coping with the presence of outlying series (i.e.,

probabilistic forecasting with DeepAR. Since deep networks can neither handle
missing input nor out-of-distribution intervention, we propose to use the
Knockoffs framework (Barberand Cand`es, 2015) for generating intervention
variables and consequently counterfactual probabilistic forecasting. Knockoff
samples are independent of their output given the observed variables and
exchangeable with their counterpart variables without changing the underlying
distribution of the data. We test our method on synthetic as well as real-world

online ensembling algorithm for streaming data whose optimization procedure
accommodates varying degrees of personalization. Namely, POSL optimizes
predictions with respect to baseline covariates, so personalization can vary
from completely individualized (i.e., optimization with respect to baseline
covariate subject ID) to many individuals (i.e., optimization with respect to
common baseline covariates). As an online algorithm, POSL learns in real-time.
POSL can leverage a diversity of candidate algorithms, including online
algorithms with different training and update times, fixed algorithms that are
never updated during the procedure, pooled algorithms that learn from many
individuals' time-series, and individualized algorithms that learn from within
a single time-series. POSL's ensembling of this hybrid of base learning
strategies depends on the amount of data collected, the stationarity of the
time-series, and the mutual characteristics of a group of time-series. In
essence, POSL decides whether to learn across samples, through time, or both,
based on the underlying (unknown) structure in the data. For a wide range of
simulations that reflect realistic forecasting scenarios, and in a medical data
application, we examine the performance of POSL relative to other current
ensembling and online learning methods. We show that POSL is able to provide
reliable predictions for time-series data and adjust to changing

ecosystem comprising multiple time series known as co-evolving time series.
Regime shifts refer to the changing behaviors exhibited by series at different
time intervals. Learning these changing behaviors is a key step toward time
series forecasting. While advances have been made, existing methods suffer from
one or more of the following shortcomings: (1) failure to take relationships
between time series into consideration for discovering regimes in multiple time
series; (2) lack of an effective approach that models time-dependent behaviors
exhibited by series; (3) difficulties in handling data discontinuities which
may be informative. Most of the existing methods are unable to handle all of
these three issues in a unified framework. This, therefore, motivates our
effort to devise a principled approach for modeling interactions and
time-dependency in co-evolving time series. Specifically, we model an ecosystem
of multiple time series by summarizing the heavy ensemble of time series into a
lighter and more meaningful structure called a \textit{mapping grid}. By using
the mapping grid, our model first learns time series behavioral dependencies
through a dynamic network representation, then learns the regime transition
mechanism via a full time-dependent Cox regression model. The originality of

In e-commerce, accurate time-series sales forecasting (TSSF) can significantly

millions of products. The trend and seasonality of products vary a lot, and the
promotion activity heavily influences sales. Besides the above difficulties, we
can know some future knowledge in advance except for the historical statistics.
Such future knowledge may reflect the influence of the future promotion
activity on current sales and help achieve better accuracy. However, most
existing TSF methods only predict the future based on historical information.
In this work, we make up for the omissions of future knowledge. Except for
introducing future knowledge for prediction, we propose Aliformer based on the

direct estimator is shown to be consistent in estimation and support recovery
under mild assumptions. These results also lead to novel consistency results

Interpretability is important in domains like healthcare where constructing

unique characteristics of clinical time series, which are unevenly sampled in
time, asynchronously acquired, and have missing data. Importantly, the hidden
state activations represent feature coefficients that correlate with the
prediction target and can be visualized as risk curves that capture the global

three stages: (i) each element is characterized by a vector of proper estimates
of the quantile cross-spectral densities, (ii) principal component analysis is
carried out to capture the main differences reducing the effects of the noise,
and (iii) the squared Euclidean distance between the first retained principal
components is used to perform clustering through the standard fuzzy C-means and
fuzzy C-medoids algorithms. The performance of the proposed approach is
evaluated in a broad simulation study where several types of generating
processes are considered, including linear, nonlinear and dynamic conditional
correlation models. Assessment is done in two different ways: by directly
measuring the quality of the resulting fuzzy partition and by taking into
account the ability of the technique to determine the overlapping nature of
series located equidistant from well-defined clusters. The procedure is
compared with the few alternatives suggested in the literature, substantially
outperforming all of them whatever the underlying process and the evaluation
scheme. Two specific applications involving air quality and financial databases
illustrate the usefulness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03728v1,stat.ME

function of a locally stationary functional time series $ \{ X_{i,n} (t) \}_{i
= 1, \ldots, n}$ is challenging as these bands can not be built on classical
limit theory. On the one hand, for a fixed argument $t$ of the functions $
X_{i,n}$, the maximum absolute deviation between an estimate and the time
dependent regression function exhibits (after appropriate standardization) an
extreme value behaviour with a Gumbel distribution in the limit. On the other
hand, for stationary functional data, simultaneous confidence bands can be
built on classical central theorems for Banach space valued random variables
and the limit distribution of the maximum absolute deviation is given by the
sup-norm of a Gaussian process. As both limit theorems have different rates of
convergence, they are not compatible, and a weak convergence result, which
could be used for the construction of a confidence surface in the locally
stationary case, does not exist.
  In this paper we propose new bootstrap methodology to construct a
simultaneous confidence band for the mean function of a locally stationary
functional time series, which is motivated by a Gaussian approximation for the
maximum absolute deviation. We prove the validity of our approach by asymptotic
theory, demonstrate good finite sample properties by means of a simulation
study and illustrate its applicability analyzing a data example.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03641v2,math.ST

past several years. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural
controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of
them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for
time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable
for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully
extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to
integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive
Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series

attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream
machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series

series classification, with many recent approaches including SAX-VSM, BOSS,
WEASEL, and MrSEQL. The key idea is to transform numerical time series to
symbolic representations in the time or frequency domain, i.e., sequences of
symbols, and then extract features from these sequences. While achieving high
accuracy, existing symbolic classifiers are computationally expensive. In this
paper we present MrSQM, a new time series classifier which uses multiple
symbolic representations and efficient sequence mining, to extract important
time series features. We study four feature selection approaches on symbolic
sequences, ranging from fully supervised, to unsupervised and hybrids. We
propose a new approach for optimal supervised symbolic feature selection in
all-subsequence space, by adapting a Chi-squared bound developed for
discriminative pattern mining, to time series. Our extensive experiments on 112
datasets of the UEA/UCR benchmark demonstrate that MrSQM can quickly extract
useful features and learn accurate classifiers with the classic logistic
regression algorithm. Interestingly, we find that a very simple and fast
feature selection strategy can be highly effective as compared with more
sophisticated and expensive methods. MrSQM advances the state-of-the-art for
symbolic time series classifiers and it is an effective method to achieve high
accuracy, with fast runtime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01036v2,cs.LG

literature. This kind of process generates a very peculiar data structure, in
which successive measurements of many process variables in each batch run are
available. Traditional approaches do not take into account the time series
nature of the data. The main reason is that the time series inference theory is
not based on replications of time series, as it is in batch process data. It is
based on the variability in a time domain. This fact demands some adaptations
of this theory in order to accommodate the model coefficient estimates,
considering jointly the batch to batch samples variability (batch domain) and
the serial correlation in each batch (time domain). In order to address this
issue, this paper proposes a new approach grounded in a group of control charts
based on the classical ARMA model for monitoring and diagnostic of batch
processes dynamics. The model coefficients are estimated (through the ordinary
least square method) for each historical time series sample batch and modified
Hotelling and t-Student distributions are derived and used to accommodate those
estimates. A group of control charts based on that distributions are proposed
for monitoring the new batches. Additionally, those groups of charts help to
fault diagnosis, identifying the source of disturbances. Through simulated and

healthcare predictive analytics tasks. First, the high-dimensional nature of
healthcare data needs labor-intensive and time-consuming processes to select an
appropriate set of features for each new task. Second, these methods depend on
feature engineering to capture the sequential nature of patient data, which may
not adequately leverage the temporal patterns of the medical events and their
dependencies. Recent deep learning methods have shown promising performance for
various healthcare prediction tasks by addressing the high-dimensional and
temporal challenges of medical data. These methods can learn useful
representations of key factors (e.g., medical concepts or patients) and their
interactions from high-dimensional raw or minimally-processed healthcare data.
In this paper we systematically reviewed studies focused on advancing and using
deep neural networks to leverage patients structured time series data for
healthcare prediction tasks. To identify relevant studies, MEDLINE, IEEE,
Scopus and ACM digital library were searched for studies published up to
February 7th 2021. We found that researchers have contributed to deep time
series prediction literature in ten research streams: deep learning models,
missing value handling, irregularity handling, patient representation, static
data inclusion, attention mechanisms, interpretation, incorporating medical
ontologies, learning strategies, and scalability. This study summarizes
research insights from these literature streams, identifies several critical
research gaps, and suggests future research opportunities for deep learning in

applications. Recent studies have shown the superiority of Transformer in
dealing with such problems, especially long sequence time series input(LSTI)
and long sequence time series forecasting(LSTF) problems. To improve the
efficiency and enhance the locality of Transformer, these studies combine
Transformer with CNN in varying degrees. However, their combinations are
loosely-coupled and do not make full use of CNN. To address this issue, we
propose the concept of tightly-coupled convolutional Transformer(TCCT) and
three TCCT architectures which apply transformed CNN architectures into
Transformer: (1) CSPAttention: through fusing CSPNet with self-attention
mechanism, the computation cost of self-attention mechanism is reduced by 30%
and the memory usage is reduced by 50% while achieving equivalent or beyond
prediction accuracy. (2) Dilated causal convolution: this method is to modify
the distilling operation proposed by Informer through replacing canonical
convolutional layers with dilated causal convolutional layers to gain
exponentially receptive field growth. (3) Passthrough mechanism: the
application of passthrough mechanism to stack of self-attention blocks helps
Transformer-like models get more fine-grained information with negligible extra
computation costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our TCCT
architectures could greatly improve the performance of existing state-of-art
Transformer models on time series forecasting with much lower computation and

referring to the past subsequence that is the closest to the current one. The
distance significance is introduced based on the online matrix profile, which
demonstrates a prominent pattern when an anomaly occurs. Another training-free
approach spectral residual is integrated into our approach to further enhance
the detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is sped up by at least
four times for long time series by the introduced cache strategy. In comparison

and analyzing large time series datasets. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM)
is a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and
clustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting
influential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure
of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time
warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it
accommodates the distortions when aligning time series. Despite its use in
clustering, DTW is limited in practice because it is quadratic in runtime
complexity with the length of the time series data. To address this, we present
a new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for
TIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based
clustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational
performance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW
computations during the SOM's training phase. We also implemented a similar
pruning strategy for K-means for comparison with one of the top performing
clustering algorithms. We evaluated the pruning effectiveness, accuracy,
execution time and scalability on 112 benchmark time series datasets from the
University of California, Riverside classification archive. We showed that for
similar accuracy, the speed-up achieved for SOMTimeS and K-means was 1.8x on
average; however, rates varied between 1x and 18x depending on the dataset.
SOMTimeS and K-means pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations,

constrains the performance of deep learning models in the field of time series
analysis. Data augmentation is an effective way to solve the problem of small
sample size and imbalance in time series datasets. The two key factors of data
augmentation are the distance metric and the choice of interpolation method.
SMOTE does not perform well on time series data because it uses a Euclidean
distance metric and interpolates directly on the object. Therefore, we propose
a DTW-based synthetic minority oversampling technique using siamese encoder for
interpolation named DTWSSE. In order to reasonably measure the distance of the
time series, DTW, which has been verified to be an effective method forts, is
employed as the distance metric. To adapt the DTW metric, we use an autoencoder
trained in an unsupervised self-training manner for interpolation. The encoder
is a Siamese Neural Network for mapping the time series data from the DTW
hidden space to the Euclidean deep feature space, and the decoder is used to
map the deep feature space back to the DTW hidden space. We validate the
proposed methods on a number of different balanced or unbalanced time series

multivariate time series data generated by networked sensors and actuators in
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Besides the highly nonlinear, complex, and
dynamic natures of such time series, the lack of labeled data impedes data
exploitation in a supervised manner and thus prevents an accurate detection of
abnormal phenomenons. On the other hand, the collected data at the edge of the
network is often privacy sensitive and large in quantity, which may hinder the
centralized training at the main server. To tackle these issues, we propose an
unsupervised time series anomaly detection framework in a federated fashion to
continuously monitor the behaviors of interconnected devices within a network
and alerts for abnormal incidents so that countermeasures can be taken before
undesired consequences occur. To be specific, we leave the training data
distributed at the edge to learn a shared Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based
on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) model, which jointly captures
feature and temporal dependencies in the multivariate time series data for
representation learning and downstream anomaly detection tasks. Experiments on

dependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world
applications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite
graph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More
concretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series
segments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between
two types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time

models have received much attention from engineering fields. Since it was
proposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising
approach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard
Bayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal
solution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel
high dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension
reduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature
about Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies
to optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method
based on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing
the acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or
dimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can
reduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies
were discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final
accuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search
based on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational
experiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm
could achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high
dimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control

series in a state space, where deterministic structures, i.e. attractors, are
revealed. Under the assumption that the evolution of solution trajectories is
described by an unknown dynamical system, we filter out stochastic outliers.
The embedding function, the solution trajectories and the dynamical systems are
constructed using deep neural networks, respectively. By exploiting the
differentiability of the neural solution trajectory, the neural dynamical
system is defined locally at each time, mitigating the need for propagating
gradients through numerical solvers. On a chaotic time series masked by
additive Gaussian noise, we demonstrate the filtering ability and the

settings and are typically characterized by sparsity (missing information) and
irregular time intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in
this domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of
values, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds
undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this
problem, we propose a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS)
model which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of
observation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation.
It employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous
time and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of
a Transformer component with multi-head attention layers which enable it to
learn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding the problems of recurrence
and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to
tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically
observed in many healthcare applications), STraTS utilizes self-supervision by
leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series
forecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Experiments on real-world multivariate

series. We would like to identify the dependency structure among these sensors

vector auto-regressive models have been widely adapted to infer the structure
of Granger causality. The resulting graph is referred to as causal graph. Our
first contribution is then extending VAR models to matrix-variate models to

focuses on sample generation. The WGAN-GP consists of a generator and
discriminator function which utilize an LSTM architecture. The WGAN-GP is
supposed to learn the underlying structure of the input data, which in our

what makes guessing the price trend hardly impossible. Through adversarial
training, the WGAN-GP should learn the underlying structure of the bitcoin and
generate very similar samples of the bitcoin distribution. The generated
synthetic time series are visually indistinguishable from the real data. But
the numerical results show that the generated data were close to the real data

domain the embedding of the time series as occurrences of a random process, our
method can identify global trends and seasonality patterns. Two spectral
attention models, global and local to the time series, integrate this
information within the forecast and perform spectral filtering to remove time
series's noise. The proposed architecture has a number of useful properties: it
can be effectively incorporated into well-know forecast architectures,

naturally arise in several applications in time series. These include the
update and prediction step of the stationary Kalman filter equations and the
prediction of bivariate time series. The celebrated Wiener-Hopf technique is
usually used for solving these equations and is based on a comparison of
coefficients in a Fourier series expansion. However, a statistical
interpretation of both the method and solution is opaque. The purpose of this
note is to revisit the (discrete) Wiener-Hopf equations and obtain an
alternative solution that is more aligned with classical techniques in time
series analysis. Specifically, we propose a solution to the Wiener-Hopf
equations that combines linear prediction with deconvolution.
  The Wiener-Hopf solution requires the spectral factorization of the
underlying spectral density function. For ease of evaluation it is often
assumed that the spectral density is rational. This allows one to obtain a
computationally tractable solution. However, this leads to an approximation
error when the underlying spectral density is not a rational function. We use

presented slower or faster than usual. Although deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) are extremely powerful in extracting information from time
series, they require explicit training to generalize to different time scales.
This paper presents a deep CNN that incorporates a temporal representation
inspired by recent findings from neuroscience. In the mammalian brain, time is
represented by populations of neurons with temporal receptive fields.
Critically, the peaks of the receptive fields form a geometric series, such
that the population codes a set of temporal basis functions over log time.
Because memory for the recent past is a function of log time, rescaling the
input results in translation of the memory. The Scale-Invariant Temporal
History Convolution network (SITHCon) builds a convolutional layer over this
logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A max-pool operation results in a
network that is invariant to rescalings of time modulo edge effects. We compare
performance of SITHCon to a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN). Although both
networks can learn classification and regression problems on both univariate
and multivariate time series f(t), only SITHCon generalizes to rescalings
f(at). This property, inspired by findings from contemporary neuroscience and
consistent with findings from cognitive psychology, may enable networks that
learn with fewer training examples, fewer weights and that generalize more

variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,
the activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in
response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the
nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple
outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations
between the output response variables are invariant in the input space.
Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend
on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output
dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for
large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series
problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal
stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint

Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to

the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break
with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a

progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired

representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term

series anomaly detection. We propose a Spliced Binned-Pareto distribution which
is both robust to extreme observations and allows accurate modeling of the full

conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models are widely applied statistical
tools for modelling volatility clusters (i.e., periods of increased or
decreased risk). In contrast, it has not been considered to be of critical
importance until now to model spatial dependence in the conditional second
moments. Only a few models have been proposed for modelling local clusters of
increased risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial GARCH process in a
unified spatial and spatiotemporal GARCH framework, which also covers all
previously proposed spatial ARCH models, exponential spatial GARCH, and
time-series GARCH models. In contrast to previous spatiotemporal and time
series models, this spatial GARCH allows for instantaneous spill-overs across
all spatial units. For this common modelling framework, estimators are derived
based on a non-linear least-squares approach. Eventually, the use of the model
is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo simulation study and by an empirical example
that focuses on real estate prices from 1995 to 2014 across the ZIP-Code areas

sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the
representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments

existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets

superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A
linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms

stage of our framework, encoders extract features from each variable
independently. Prototype layers identify single-variable prototypes in the
resulting feature spaces. The next stage of our framework represents the
multivariable time series sample points in terms of their similarity to these

representation of multivariable patterns, on which prototype learning is
applied to extract representative examples i.e. multivariable prototypes. Our
framework is thus able to explicitly identify both informative patterns in the

hierarchical constraints using the coefficients of the basis decomposition. And
second, using a linear autoregressive model with coefficients that vary with

Dynamask studies the effects of dynamic perturbation operators. In order to
tackle the large number of inputs, we propose a scheme to make the feature

the most recent observations preceding it. The set of all relevant contexts are
represented as a discrete context-tree. At the bottom level, a different
real-valued time series model is associated with each context-state, i.e., with
each leaf of the tree. This defines a very general framework that can be used
in conjunction with any existing model class to build flexible and
interpretable mixture models. Extending the idea of context-tree weighting
leads to algorithms that allow for efficient, exact Bayesian inference in this

Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we

We use Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) to represent the functions,
considering then the basis associated to the reproducing kernel. Using a simple
decision rule, we classify the points on the projected space among those
belonging to the minimum entropy set and those that do not. We push back the
minimum entropy set to the functional space and construct a band using the
regularity property of the RKHS. The proposed methodology is illustrated

represents an anomalous instance. Discrepancies in the nature itself of an
anomaly lead to multiple paradigms of algorithms design and experimentation.
Predictive maintenance is a special case, where the anomaly represents a
failure that must be prevented. Related time-series research as outlier and
novelty detection or time-series classification does not apply to the concept
of an anomaly in this field, because they are not single points which have not
been seen previously and may not be precisely annotated. Moreover, due to the
lack of annotated anomalous data, many benchmarks are adapted from supervised
scenarios.
  To address these issues, we generalise the concept of positive and negative
instances to intervals to be able to evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection
algorithms. We also preserve the imbalance scheme for evaluation through the
proposal of the Preceding Window ROC, a generalisation for the calculation of
ROC curves for time-series scenarios. We also adapt the mechanism from a
established time-series anomaly detection benchmark to the proposed
generalisations to reward early detection. Therefore, the proposal represents a
flexible evaluation framework for the different scenarios. To show the
usefulness of this definition, we include a case study of Big Data algorithms

amortized adaptive importance proposals of time series. MCFOs extend the
choices of likelihood estimators beyond Sequential Monte Carlo in
state-of-the-art objectives, possess important properties revealing the factors
for the tightness of objectives, and allow for less biased and variant gradient

Specifically, we utilize the similarities across the time series channels by
the stacking block-wise reconstruction with a weight-sharing scheme to reduce
the size of learned models and also relieve the overfitting to unknown noises
in the training data. We also leverage a graph learning module to learn a
sparse adjacency matrix to explicitly capture the stable interrelation
structure among multiple time series channels for the interpretable pattern
reconstruction of interrelated channels. Combining these two modules, we
introduce the stacking block-wise VAE (variational autoencoder) with GNN (graph
neural network) model for multivariate time series anomaly detection. We
conduct extensive experiments on three commonly used public datasets, showing
that our model achieves comparable (even better) performance with the

representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often
lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from
previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the
semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized
representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled
representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of
learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored
due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex
temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,
2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable
semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of
individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a
novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,
to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and
disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level
disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group
semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL
vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while
preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL
to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various
real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by
DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high

existing data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great
deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for
high-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we

generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real

transport maps on each other, where predictors can be transport maps from an
overall barycenter to a current distribution or transport maps between past
consecutive distributions of the distributional time series. Autoregressive
transport models and their associated distributional regression models specify
the link between predictor and response transport maps by moving along
geodesics in Wasserstein space. These models emerge as natural extensions of
the classical autoregressive models in Euclidean space. Unique stationary
solutions of autoregressive transport models are shown to exist under a
geometric moment contraction condition of Wu and Shao (2004), using properties
of iterated random functions. We also discuss an extension to a varying

Among the two proposed methods, the first one is a straightforward adaptation
to FTS of the $k$-nearest neighbors methods for univariate time series

curve envelope}, that aims to be representative in shape and magnitude of the

forecasting. In doing so, we keep track of the next period evolution of the
curves. The methods are applied to simulated data, daily electricity demand,

the primary focus to overcome the uneconomic retraining requirements and
inflexible representation learning in current deep learning-based systems.
Multi-track time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale due to
increased sensors and data storage. These datasets hold valuable patterns, like
in neuromarketing, where researchers try to link patterns in multivariate
sequential data from physiological sensors to the purchase behavior of products
and services. But a lack of ground truth and high variance make automatic
pattern detection unreliable. Our advancements are based on a novel query-aware
locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a feature-based representation
of multivariate time series windows. Most importantly, our algorithm features
sub-linear training and inference time. We can even accomplish both the
modeling and comparison of 10,000 different 64-track time series, each with 100
time steps (a typical EEG dataset) under 0.8 seconds. This performance gain
allows for a rapid relevance feedback-driven adaption of the underlying pattern
similarity model and enables the user to modify the speed-vs-accuracy trade-off
gradually. We demonstrate superiority of PSEUDo in terms of efficiency,
accuracy, and steerability through a quantitative performance comparison and a
qualitative visual quality comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the
field. Moreover, we showcase the usability of PSEUDo through a case study
demonstrating our visual pattern retrieval concepts in a large meteorological
dataset. We find that our adaptive models can accurately capture the user's
notion of similarity and allow for an understandable exploratory visual pattern
retrieval in large multivariate time series datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14962v2,cs.LG

December 2019. It has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed
restrictions and costs to many countries. Predicting the number of new cases
and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and
facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new
cases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days.
The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the
investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still
achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered in
real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are
examined on the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM,
Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional extension is then considered for
each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and
Iran countries.
  This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the
aforementioned three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions
to perform prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new death rate time series. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM
models are used for prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new deaths time
series. The evaluation of the methods is presented in the form of graphs and
Friedman statistical test. The results show that the bidirectional models have
lower errors than other models. A several error evaluation metrics are
presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of bidirectional
methods is determined. This research could be useful for organisations working

autocorrelation of count time series data is typically estimated in the
state-space modelling framework through extended Kalman filter. However,
because of the complex dependencies in count time series, estimation becomes
more challenging. PAR is viewed as an additive model and estimated using a
hybrid of cubic smoothing splines and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in
the backfitting framework. Simulation studies show that this estimation method
is comparable or better than PAR estimated in the state-space context,
especially with larger count values. However, as [2] formulated PAR for
stationary counts, both estimation procedures underestimate parameters in
nearly nonstationary models. The flexibility of the additive model has two
benefits though: robust estimation in the presence of temporary structural
change, and; viability to integrate PAR model into a more complex model

gradient and the underlying seasonality as features. The procedure allows to
return a probability for each observation being outlying data as well as a
specific cause for an outlier assignment in terms of the provided feature

forecasting from the perspective of compressed sensing. They proposed a
no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and
proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series from its
observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank. While
impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied
whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the
presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by
integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose
for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of
convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resultant model, termed
Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part
of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally
low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success
conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component
Pursuit (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data
argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of
time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use
of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM
can be used as a general tool for model combination. Extensive experiments on
100,452 real-world time series from Time Series Data Library (TSDL) and M4

and it is often generated in real time, such as transportation passenger
volume, network traffic, system resource consumption, energy usage, and human
gait. Detecting anomalous events based on machine learning approaches in such
time series data has been an active research topic in many different areas.
However, most machine learning approaches require labeled datasets, offline
training, and may suffer from high computation complexity, consequently
hindering their applicability. Providing a lightweight self-adaptive approach
that does not need offline training in advance and meanwhile is able to detect
anomalies in real time could be highly beneficial. Such an approach could be
immediately applied and deployed on any commodity machine to provide timely
anomaly alerts. To facilitate such an approach, this paper introduces SALAD,
which is a Self-Adaptive Lightweight Anomaly Detection approach based on a
special type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
Instead of using offline training, SALAD converts a target time series into a
series of average absolute relative error (AARE) values on the fly and predicts
an AARE value for every upcoming data point based on short-term historical AARE
values. If the difference between a calculated AARE value and its corresponding
forecast AARE value is higher than a self-adaptive detection threshold, the
corresponding data point is considered anomalous. Otherwise, the data point is
considered normal. Experiments based on two real-world open-source time series
datasets demonstrate that SALAD outperforms five other state-of-the-art anomaly
detection approaches in terms of detection accuracy. In addition, the results
also show that SALAD is lightweight and can be deployed on a commodity machine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09968v3,cs.LG

can have a distribution compatible with a standard univariate time series model
such as GARCH, ARMA, INGARCH or logistic models whereas past values of the
other coordinates play the role of exogenous covariates in the dynamic. The
simultaneous dependence in the multivariate time series can be modeled with a
copula. Additional exogenous covariates are also allowed in the dynamic. We
first study usual stability properties of these models and then show that
autoregressive parameters can be consistently estimated equation-by-equation
using a pseudo-maximum likelihood method, leading to a fast implementation even
when the number of time series is large. Moreover, we prove consistency results
when a parametric copula model is fitted to the time series and in the case of
Gaussian copulas, we show that the likelihood estimator of the correlation
matrix is strongly consistent. We carefully check all our assumptions for two
prototypical examples: a GARCH/INGARCH model and logistic/log-linear INGARCH
model. Our results are illustrated with numerical experiments as well as two
real data sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01067v1,stat.ME

labels has been one of the most important challenges in a wide range of
disciplines. Recent studies on time series classification show that
convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved the state-of-the-art performance

layer that is usually adopted by existing CNN classifiers discards the temporal
information of high-level features, we present a dynamic temporal pooling (DTP)
technique that reduces the temporal size of hidden representations by
aggregating the features at the segment-level. For the partition of a whole
series into multiple segments, we utilize dynamic time warping (DTW) to align
each time point in a temporal order with the prototypical features of the
segments, which can be optimized simultaneously with the network parameters of
CNN classifiers. The DTP layer combined with a fully-connected layer helps to
extract further discriminative features considering their temporal position
within an input time series. Extensive experiments on both univariate and
multivariate time series datasets show that our proposed pooling significantly

process is especially challenging with time series data where the observations

performance estimation methods compare with each other for approximating the
true loss incurred by a given forecasting model. However, these studies do not
address how the estimators behave for model selection: the ability to select
the best solution among a set of alternatives. We address this issue and
compare a set of estimation methods for model selection in time series
forecasting tasks. We attempt to answer two main questions: (i) how often is
the best possible model selected by the estimators; and (ii) what is the
performance loss when it does not. We empirically found that the accuracy of
the estimators for selecting the best solution is low, and the overall
forecasting performance loss associated with the model selection process ranges
from 1.2% to 2.3%. We also discovered that some factors, such as the sample

Time series decomposition is a major preprocessing task, to separate
nonstationary effects (the deterministic components) from the remaining
stochastic constituent, assumed to be stationary. The deterministic components
are predictable and contribute to the prediction through estimations or
extrapolation. Fitting the most appropriate model to the remaining stochastic

we refer to as Classical Parameters Tuning in Weighted Nearest Neighbors and
Fast Parameters Tuning in Weighted Nearest Neighbors. The first approach uses
classical parameters tuning that compares the most recent subsequence with
every possible subsequence from the past of the same length. The second
approach reduces the neighbors' search set, which leads to significantly
reduced grid size and hence a lower computational time. To tune the models'

the instantaneous rate of change in the state of a system. However, despite
their apparent suitability for dynamics-governed time-series, NODEs present a
few disadvantages. First, they are unable to adapt to incoming data points, a
fundamental requirement for real-time applications imposed by the natural
direction of time. Second, time series are often composed of a sparse set of
measurements that could be explained by many possible underlying dynamics.
NODEs do not capture this uncertainty. In contrast, Neural Processes (NPs) are
a family of models providing uncertainty estimation and fast data adaptation
but lack an explicit treatment of the flow of time. To address these problems,
we introduce Neural ODE Processes (NDPs), a new class of stochastic processes
determined by a distribution over Neural ODEs. By maintaining an adaptive
data-dependent distribution over the underlying ODE, we show that our model can
successfully capture the dynamics of low-dimensional systems from just a few
data points. At the same time, we demonstrate that NDPs scale up to challenging

performance of the most popular architectures. The comparison involves a
thorough analysis of seven types of deep learning models in terms of accuracy

the correlations among vertices (e.g., speeds at different locations) at
different timestamps. Second, we employ recurrent neural networks to take into

matrix series are uncorrelated across all times. Hence an overall parsimonious
model is achieved by modelling each of those small matrix series separately
without the loss of information on the linear dynamics. Such a parsimonious
model often has better forecasting performance, even when the underlying true
dynamics deviates from the assumed uncorrelated block structure after
transformation. The uniform convergence rates of the estimated transformation
are derived, which vindicate an important virtue of the proposed bilinear
transformation, i.e. it is technically equivalent to the decorrelation of a

useful guidance on model selection for data analytics practitioners. Data
scarcity is a universal issue that occurs in a vast range of data analytics
problems, due to the high costs associated with collecting, generating, and

Observing that all existing works are incapable of utilizing the sparse time
series inputs for proper modeling building, we propose a model called sparse
functional multilayer perceptron (SFMLP) for handling the sparsity in the time

applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both
intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations
simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both
correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations
in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series
relationships.
  In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to
further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN
captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies \textit{jointly}
in the \textit{spectral domain}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)
which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing
through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can
be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules.
Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data
without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten

resampling approach called 'I-Rand' for independently sampling one of the two
time points for each individual and making inference on the estimated causal

from a service-based dietary intervention to promote a low-carbohydrate diet

pre-intervention health record of study participants, and health data after LCD
intervention are recorded at the follow-up visit, providing a two-point

and analysis of their processes, especially in combination with time series as
produced by sensors. Time series data can be exploited to, for example, explain
and predict concept drifts during runtime. Generally, a certain data volume is
required in order to produce meaningful analysis results. However, reliable
data sets are often missing, for example, if event streams and times series
data are collected separately, in case of a new process, or if it is too
expensive to obtain a sufficient data volume. Additional challenges arise with
preparing time series data from multiple event sources, variations in data
collection frequency, and concept drift. This paper proposes the GENLOG
approach to generate reliable event and time series data that follows the
distribution of the underlying input data set. GENLOG employs data resampling
and enables the user to select different parts of the log data to orchestrate
the training of a recurrent neural network for stream generation. The generated
data is sampled back to its original sample rate and is embedded into the
originating log data file. Overall, GENLOG can boost small data sets and
consequently the application of online process mining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05462v3,cs.LG

order to discover multiple phases underlying dynamics of complex systems. This
computing approach is developed as a multiple-dimension version of Hierarchical
Factor Segmentation(HFS) technique. This expanded approach proposes a
systematic protocol of choosing various extreme events in multi-dimensional
space. Upon each chosen event, an empirical distribution of event-recurrence,
or waiting time between the excursions, is fitted by a geometric distribution
with time-varying parameters. Iterative fittings are performed across all
chosen events. We then collect and summarize the local recurrent patterns into
a global dynamic mechanism. Clustering is applied for partitioning the whole
time period into alternating segments, in which variables are identically
distributed. Feature weighting techniques are also considered to compensate for
some drawbacks of clustering. Our simulation results show that this expanded
approach can even detect systematic differences when the joint distribution
varies. In real data experiments, we analyze the relationship from returns,
trading volume, and transaction number of a single, as well as of multiple

To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative model, which tracks
the transition of latent clusters, instead of isolated feature representations,
to achieve robust modeling. It is characterized by a newly designed dynamic
Gaussian mixture distribution, which captures the dynamics of clustering
structures, and is used for emitting timeseries. The generative model is
parameterized by neural networks. A structured inference network is also
designed for enabling inductive analysis. A gating mechanism is further

efficiently alleviated via stratification, which allows the optimizer to sample
from pre-grouped time series strata. For better trading-off gradient variance

can give higher accuracy for a plethora of learning problems and datasets. In
the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their
overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models

multidimensional time-series datasets. Missing values are commonplace in
decision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from
disparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of
missing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety
of algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods
like SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning
methods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics
compared to just excluding the missing data. DeepMVI uses a neural network to
combine fine-grained and coarse-grained patterns along a time series, and
trends from related series across categorical dimensions. After failing with
off-the-shelf neural architectures, we design our own network that includes a
temporal transformer with a novel convolutional window feature, and kernel
regression with learned embeddings. The parameters and their training are
designed carefully to generalize across different placements of missing blocks
and data characteristics. Experiments across nine real datasets, four different
missing scenarios, comparing seven existing methods show that DeepMVI is
significantly more accurate, reducing error by more than 50% in more than half

This method is inspired by the concept that warped parts of two time series

look-ahead-bias in the future performance on the downstream task. There is an
inherent trade-off between the look-ahead-bias of using the full data set for
imputation and the larger variance in the imputation from using only the

series that are hierarchically related via aggregation or disaggregation

addition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another.
Although forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by

assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution
being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power
of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In this

domains such as econometry, finance or meteorology. For discrete-valued
regimes, some models such as the popular Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) describe
time series whose state process is unknown at all time-steps. Sometimes, time
series are firstly labelled thanks to some annotation function. Thus, another
category of models handles the case with regimes observed at all time-steps. We
present a novel model which addresses the intermediate case: (i) state
processes associated to such time series are modelled by Partially Hidden
Markov Chains (PHMCs); (ii) a linear autoregressive (LAR) model drives the
dynamics of the time series, within each regime. We describe a variant of the
expection maximization (EM) algorithm devoted to PHMC-LAR model learning. We
propose a hidden state inference procedure and a forecasting function that take
into account the observed states when existing. We assess inference and
prediction performances, and analyze EM convergence times for the new model,
using simulated data. We show the benefits of using partially observed states
to decrease EM convergence times. A fully labelled scheme with unreliable
labels also speeds up EM. This offers promising prospects to enhance PHMC-LAR
model selection. We also point out the robustness of PHMC-LAR to labelling

surprising claim. In spite of the fact that there are dozens of papers on early
classification of time series, it is not clear that any of them could ever work

forecasting problems in practice, where there is a limited number of time
series or observations per time series, or both. To cope with this data
scarcity issue, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, Domain
Adaptation Forecaster (DAF). DAF leverages statistical strengths from a
relevant domain with abundant data samples (source) to improve the performance
on the domain of interest with limited data (target). In particular, we use an
attention-based shared module with a domain discriminator across domains and
private modules for individual domains. We induce domain-invariant latent
features (queries and keys) and retrain domain-specific features (values)
simultaneously to enable joint training of forecasters on source and target
domains. A main insight is that our design of aligning keys allows the target
domain to leverage source time series even with different characteristics.
Extensive experiments on various domains demonstrate that our proposed method

RePAD utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect whether or not each

Selector (NFS), as an end-2-end solution for feature selection in MTS data.
Specifically, NFS is based on decomposed convolution design and includes two
modules: firstly each feature stream (a stream corresponds to an univariate
series of MTS) within MTS is processed by a temporal CNN independently; then an
aggregating CNN combines the processed streams to produce input for other
downstream networks. We evaluated the proposed NFS model on four real-world MTS

lower bounds, allowing to avoid costly distance computations when a given

process, also allows to early abandon the computation of a distance itself.
Another approach, is to prune parts of the computation. All these techniques

substantial speedup for some distances, benefiting applications beyond the

with flexible neural networks, resulting in a non-stationary model that can
work without the assumption of constant noise as commonly made by existing
Markov models. However, such a flexibility may cause the model fragile to
anomalies. To achieve robust density estimation which can also benefit
detection tasks, we propose a smoothness-inducing prior over possible
estimations. The proposed prior works as a regularizer that places penalty at
non-smooth reconstructions. Our model is learned efficiently with a novel
stochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator. In particular, we study two
decision criteria for anomaly detection: reconstruction probability and
reconstruction error. We show the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic
datasets and public real-world benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01331v1,cs.LG

However, existing models are mainly designated for either synchronous
time-series or asynchronous event sequence, and can hardly provide a synthetic
way to capture the relation between them. We propose Variational Synergetic
Multi-Horizon Network (VSMHN), a novel deep conditional generative model. To
learn complex correlations across heterogeneous sequences, a tailored encoder
is devised to combine the advances in deep point processes models and
variational recurrent neural networks. In addition, an aligned time coding and
an auxiliary transition scheme are carefully devised for batched training on
unaligned sequences. Our model can be trained effectively using stochastic
variational inference and generates probabilistic predictions with Monte-Carlo

series. In particular, our ARD network can incorporate the uncertainty of the
exogenous variables and eventually helps identify useful exogenous variables

correlation (STC) between sensors, and require pre-defined graphs, which are
neither always available nor totally reliable, and target at only a specific
type of sensor data at one time. Moreover, since the form of time-series
fluctuation is varied across sensors, a model needs to learn fluctuation
modulation. To tackle these issues, in this work, we propose a novel GNN-based
model, Attention-adjusted Graph Spatio-Temporal Network (AGSTN). In AGSTN,
multi-graph convolution with sequential learning is developed to learn

the temporality of the data, which makes such maximum likelihood estimations
inaccurate. In this paper, in order to adjust for autocorrelated errors, we
propose to learn the autocorrelation coefficient jointly with the model
parameters. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our approach on
time series forecasting. Results across a wide range of real-world datasets
with various state-of-the-art models show that our method enhances performance
in almost all cases. Based on these results, we suggest empirical critical

recent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed
in order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series. It is more

improved HOT SAX by exploiting two main ideas: the warm-up process, and the
similarity between sequences close in time. The resulting algorithm, called HOT
SAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and
successfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD. The complexity of a
discord search has been evaluated with a new indicator, the cost per sequence
(cps), which allows one to compare searches on time series of different
lengths. Numerical evidence suggests that two conditions are involved in
determining the complexity of a discord search in a non-trivial way: the length
of the discords, and the noise/signal ratio. In the case of complex searches,

research task. With the wide application of deep learning, more and more
researchers use deep learning models to solve TSC problems. Since time series
always contains a lot of noise, which has a negative impact on network
training, people usually filter the original data before training the network.
The existing schemes are to treat the filtering and training as two stages, and
the design of the filter requires expert experience, which increases the design
difficulty of the algorithm and is not universal. We note that the essence of
filtering is to filter out the insignificant frequency components and highlight
the important ones, which is similar to the attention mechanism. In this paper,
we propose an attention mechanism that acts on spectrum (SAM). The network can
assign appropriate weights to each frequency component to achieve adaptive
filtering. We use L1 regularization to further enhance the frequency screening
capability of SAM. We also propose a segmented-SAM (SSAM) to avoid the loss of
time domain information caused by using the spectrum of the whole sequence. In
which, a tumbling window is introduced to segment the original data. Then SAM
is applied to each segment to generate new features. We propose a heuristic
strategy to search for the appropriate number of segments. Experimental results

measured cable forces by recognizing biased patterns from the intact
conditions. The proposed method solves the pattern recognition problem for
cable damage detection through time series classification (TSC) in deep
learning, considering that the cable's behavior can be implicitly represented
by the measured cable force series. A deep learning model, long short term
memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN), is leveraged by assigning
appropriate inputs and representative class labels for the TSC problem, First,
a TSC classifier is trained and validated using the data collected under intact
conditions of stay cables, setting the segmented data series as input and the
cable (or cable pair) ID as class labels. Subsequently, the classifier is
tested using the data collected under possible damaged conditions. Finally, the
cable or cable pair corresponding to the least classification accuracy is
recommended as the most probable damaged cable or cable pair. The proposed
method was tested on an in-service cable-stayed bridge with damaged stay
cables. Two scenarios in the proposed TSC scheme were investigated: 1) raw time
series of cable forces were fed into the classifiers; and 2) cable force ratios
were inputted in the classifiers considering the possible variation of force
distribution between cable pairs due to cable damage. Combining the results of
TSC testing in these two scenarios, the cable with rupture was correctly
identified. This study proposes a data-driven methodology for cable damage
detection that requires the least data preprocessing and feature engineering,
which enables fast and convenient early detection in real applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03701v1,cs.LG

detection by applying Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). Time series anomaly
detection is a very common but challenging task in many industries, which plays
an important role in network monitoring, facility maintenance, information

transforming 1D time series to 2D image as input, and adopting the
reconstruction error to detect anomalies. Besides, we also apply the Generative
Adversarial Networks based techniques to T2IVAE training strategy, aiming to
reduce the overfitting. We evaluate our model performance on three datasets,
and compare it with other several popular models using F1 score. T2IVAE

changepoint techniques for time series data. Due to their importance in
inferential matters, changepoint research on correlated data has accelerated
recently. Unfortunately, small perturbations in model assumptions can
drastically alter changepoint conclusions; for example, heavy positive
correlation in a time series can be misattributed to a mean shift should
correlation be ignored. This paper considers both single and multiple
changepoint techniques. The paper begins by examining cumulative sum (CUSUM)
and likelihood ratio tests and their variants for the single changepoint
problem; here, various statistics, boundary cropping scenarios, and scaling
methods (e.g., scaling to an extreme value or Brownian Bridge limit) are
compared. A recently developed test based on summing squared CUSUM statistics
over all times is shown to have realistic Type I errors and superior detection
power. The paper then turns to the multiple changepoint setting. Here,
penalized likelihoods drive the discourse, with AIC, BIC, mBIC, and MDL
penalties being considered. Binary and wild binary segmentation techniques are
also compared. We introduce a new distance metric specifically designed to
compare two multiple changepoint segmentations. Algorithmic and computational
concerns are discussed and simulations are provided to support all conclusions.
In the end, the multiple changepoint setting admits no clear methodological
winner, performance depending on the particular scenario. Nonetheless, some

changes in brain network connectivity. We propose large-scale Extended Granger
Causality (lsXGC) and investigate whether it can capture such changes using
resting-state fMRI. This method combines dimension reduction with source
time-series augmentation and uses predictive time-series modeling for
estimating directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. It is a
multivariate approach, since it is capable of identifying the interdependence
of time-series in the presence of all other time-series of the underlying
dynamic system. Here, we investigate whether this model can serve as a
biomarker for classifying marijuana users from typical controls using 126 adult
subjects with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD from the Addiction Connectome
Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI) database. We use brain connections estimated by
lsXGC as features for classification. After feature extraction, we perform
feature selection by Kendall's-tau rank correlation coefficient followed by
classification using a support vector machine. As a reference method, we
compare our results with cross-correlation, which is typically used in the
literature as a standard measure of functional connectivity. Within a
cross-validation scheme of 100 different training/test (90%/10%) data splits,
we obtain a mean accuracy range of [0.714, 0.985] and a mean Area Under the

Smart meters typically collect and provide energy time series that are vital
for various applications, such as grid simulations, fault-detection, load
forecasting, load analysis, and load management. Unfortunately, these time
series are often characterized by missing values that must be handled before
the data can be used. A common approach to handle missing values in time series
is imputation. However, existing imputation methods are designed for power time
series and do not take into account the total energy of gaps, resulting in
jumps or constant shifts when imputing energy time series. In order to overcome
these issues, the present paper introduces the new Copy-Paste Imputation (CPI)
method for energy time series. The CPI method copies data blocks with similar
properties and pastes them into gaps of the time series while preserving the
total energy of each gap. The new method is evaluated on a real-world dataset
that contains six shares of artificially inserted missing values between 1 and
30%. It outperforms by far the three benchmark imputation methods selected for

models that work on isolated series. As GFMs usually share the same set of
parameters across all time series, they often have the problem of not being
localised enough to a particular series, especially in situations where
datasets are heterogeneous. We study how ensembling techniques can be used with
generic GFMs and univariate models to solve this issue. Our work systematises
and compares relevant current approaches, namely clustering series and training
separate submodels per cluster, the so-called ensemble of specialists approach,

gaps in the existing GFM localisation approaches, in particular by
incorporating varied clustering techniques such as feature-based clustering,

has changed from predicting isolated time series to predicting many time series
from similar sources. This has opened up the opportunity to develop competitive
global forecasting models that simultaneously learn from many time series. But,
it still remains unclear when global forecasting models can outperform the
univariate benchmarks, especially along the dimensions of the
homogeneity/heterogeneity of series, the complexity of patterns in the series,
the complexity of forecasting models, and the lengths/number of series. Our
study attempts to address this problem through investigating the effect from
these factors, by simulating a number of datasets that have controllable time
series characteristics. Specifically, we simulate time series from simple data
generating processes (DGP), such as Auto Regressive (AR) and Seasonal AR, to
complex DGPs, such as Chaotic Logistic Map, Self-Exciting Threshold
Auto-Regressive, and Mackey-Glass Equations. The data heterogeneity is
introduced by mixing time series generated from several DGPs into a single
dataset. The lengths and the number of series in the dataset are varied in
different scenarios. We perform experiments on these datasets using global
forecasting models including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Feed-Forward
Neural Networks, Pooled Regression (PR) models and Light Gradient Boosting
Models (LGBM), and compare their performance against standard statistical
univariate forecasting techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that when

Most of the existing works in this area are based on the learning of the
domain-invariant representation of the data with the help of restrictions like
MMD. However, such extraction of the domain-invariant representation is a
non-trivial task for time series data, due to the complex dependence among the
timestamps. In detail, in the fully dependent time series, a small change of
the time lags or the offsets may lead to difficulty in the domain invariant
extraction. Fortunately, the stability of the causality inspired us to explore
the domain invariant structure of the data. To reduce the difficulty in the
discovery of causal structure, we relax it to the sparse associative structure
and propose a novel sparse associative structure alignment model for domain
adaptation. First, we generate the segment set to exclude the obstacle of
offsets. Second, the intra-variables and inter-variables sparse attention
mechanisms are devised to extract associative structure time-series data with
considering time lags. Finally, the associative structure alignment is used to
guide the transfer of knowledge from the source domain to the target one.

explored for a couple of decades. However, they still remain challenging, and
their solutions need to be further improved for real-world applications in
terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
neural architecture, called Self-Attentive Recurrent Convolutional Networks

SARCoN is the synthesis of long short-term memory networks with self-attentive
mechanisms and Fully Convolutional Networks, which work in parallel to learn
the representations of univariate time series from different perspectives. The
component modules of the proposed architecture are trained jointly in an
end-to-end manner and they classify the input time series in a cooperative way.
Due to its domain-agnostic nature, SARCoN is able to generalize a diversity of
domain tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches for time series classification, the proposed
architecture can achieve remarkable improvements for a set of univariate time
series benchmarks from the UCR repository. Moreover, the self-attention and the
global average pooling in the proposed architecture enable visible
interpretability by facilitating the identification of the contribution regions
of the original time series. An overall analysis confirms that multi-faceted
representations of time series aid in capturing deep temporal corrections
within complex time series, which is essential for the improvement of time
series classification performance. Our work provides a novel angle that deepens
the understanding of time series classification, qualifying our proposed model

Previous interpretation methods, including the methods for general neural

feature dimension while ignoring the crucial temporal dimension. In this paper,
we present the series saliency framework for temporal interpretation for
multivariate time series forecasting, which considers the forecasting
interpretation in both feature and temporal dimensions. By extracting the
""series images"" from the sliding windows of the time series, we apply the
saliency map segmentation following the smallest destroying region principle.
The series saliency framework can be employed to any well-defined deep learning

detectors, and more. Regardless of their root causes, such data severely affect
the results of the subsequent analysis. This paper demonstrates data cleaning
and preparation for time-series data and further proposes cost-sensitive
machine learning algorithms as a solution to detect anomalous data points in
time-series data. The following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
Support Vector Machines have been modified to support the cost-sensitive

Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several
severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable
to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent

comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the
self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading
layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the

other settings, notably the problem of registration (alignment) of observed
signals. Typical approaches include pre-registration to a user-specified
template or time warping approaches which attempt to optimally align series
with a minimum of distortion. For many signals obtained from recording or
sensing devices, these methods may be unsuitable as a template signal is not
available for pre-registration, while the distortion of warping approaches may
obscure meaningful temporal information. We propose a new method for automatic
time series alignment within a clustering problem. Our approach, Temporal
Registration using Optimal Unitary Transformations (TROUT), is based on a novel
dissimilarity measure between time series that is easy to compute and
automatically identifies optimal alignment between pairs of time series. By
embedding our new measure in a optimization formulation, we retain well-known

Among which time series is common in many scenarios like credit card payment,
user behavior, and sensors. General feature selection for features extracted by
sliding window aggregate calls for time-consuming iteration to generate
features, and then traditional feature selection methods are employed to rank

automatic method to handle the sliding window aggregate features selection. As
the time consumption of feature generation with different periods and sliding
windows is huge, it is very hard to enumerate them all and then select them.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework using Markov Chain to solve
this problem. This framework is very efficient and has high accuracy, such that
it is able to perform feature selection on a variety of features and period

learn mathematical mappings from multiple chronologically measured numerical
variables within a certain time interval S to multiple numerical variables of
interest over time interval T. Prior arts, including the multivariate
regression model, the Seq2Seq model, and the functional linear models, suffer
from several limitations. The first two types of models can only handle

incorrectly specified, our predictions using this model may generalise poorly;
similarly, if the noise process is incorrectly specified, we can attribute too
much or too little observed variation to the signal. With little justification,
independent Gaussian noise is typically chosen, which defines a statistical
model that is simple to implement but often misstates system uncertainty and
may underestimate error autocorrelation. There are a range of alternative noise
processes available but, in practice, none of these may be entirely
appropriate, as actual noise may be better characterised as a time-varying
mixture of these various types. Here, we consider systems where the signal is

the conflation of time and feature domains, and (iii) the quality of saliency

Developing deep learning methods on EHRs data is critical for personalized
treatment, precise diagnosis and medical management. However, it is challenging
to directly use deep learning models for ISMTS data. On the one hand, ISMTS
data has the intra-series and inter-series relations. Both the local and global
structures should be considered. On the other hand, methods should consider the
trade-off between task accuracy and model complexity and remain generality and
interpretability. So far, many existing works have tried to solve the above
problems and have achieved good results. In this paper, we review these deep
learning methods from the perspectives of technology and task. Under the
technology-driven perspective, we summarize them into two categories - missing
data-based methods and raw data-based methods. Under the task-driven

time-series, a common paradigm is to partition the data into approximately
stationary intervals and perform inference in the time-frequency domain.
However, this approach lacks a corresponding nonstationary time-domain
generative model for the entire data and thus, time-domain inference occurs in
each interval separately. This results in distortion/discontinuity around
interval boundaries and can consequently lead to erroneous inferences based on
any quantities derived from the posterior, such as the phase. To address these
shortcomings, we propose the Piecewise Locally Stationary Oscillation (PLSO)
model for decomposing time-series data with slowly time-varying spectra into
several oscillatory, piecewise-stationary processes. PLSO, as a nonstationary
time-domain generative model, enables inference on the entire time-series
without boundary effects and simultaneously provides a characterization of its
time-varying spectral properties. We also propose a novel two-stage inference

in time series forecasting applications. However, when dealing with
hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting

base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent.
Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly
supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base
forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the
most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we
propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical
forecasting method and succeeding better forecasting accuracy along with
coherence. The approach, to be called conditional hierarchical forecasting, is
based on Machine Learning classification methods and uses time series features
as leading indicators for performing the selection for each hierarchy examined

predicting future values as they are not based on the strict assumptions of
traditional time series forecasting methods. Non-stochastic methods of fuzzy

fuzzification rules or feature representation of crisp time series (3) method
of establishing fuzzy logic rule (FLRs) between input and target values (4)

optimal number of intervals (NOIs) and used fuzzy c-means clustering process to
divide UOD into intervals of unequal length. We implement support vector

method for time-series data imputation models. In RDIS, we generate extra
missing values by applying a random drop on the observed values in incomplete

circumvent this non-validity by introducing a higher-order bootstrap scheme

estimate coefficients of such a representation efficiently, we rely on the
alternative formulation of Volterra operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert

not a positive definite divergence: due to the bias introduced by entropic
regularization, it can be negative and it is not minimized when the time series

divergence, which aims to correct these issues. We study its properties; in
particular, under conditions on the ground cost, we show that it is a valid
divergence: it is non-negative and minimized if and only if the two time series

While such systems often are very accurate, they have no inherent mechanism for

for trustworthy and reliable decision support, namely a notion of uncertainty.
In this paper, we address this lack of uncertainty by proposing a deep ensemble
approach where a collection of DNNs are trained independently. A measure of
uncertainty in the relevance scores is computed by taking the standard
deviation across the relevance scores produced by each model in the ensemble,
which in turn is used to make the explanations more reliable. The class
activation mapping method is used to assign a relevance score for each time
step in the time series. Results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble is more
accurate in locating relevant time steps and is more consistent across random
initializations, thus making the model more trustworthy. The proposed

modeling large collections of time-series. However, these techniques explicitly
assume either complete independence (local model) or complete dependence
(global model) between time-series in the collection. This corresponds to the
two extreme cases where every time-series is disconnected from every other
time-series in the collection or likewise, that every time-series is related to
every other time-series resulting in a completely connected graph. In this
work, we propose a deep hybrid probabilistic graph-based forecasting framework
called Graph Deep Factors (GraphDF) that goes beyond these two extremes by
allowing nodes and their time-series to be connected to others in an arbitrary
fashion. GraphDF is a hybrid forecasting framework that consists of a
relational global and relational local model. In particular, we propose a
relational global model that learns complex non-linear time-series patterns
globally using the structure of the graph to improve both forecasting accuracy
and computational efficiency. Similarly, instead of modeling every time-series
independently, we learn a relational local model that not only considers its
individual time-series but also the time-series of nodes that are connected in

practical applications. In recent years, anomaly detection algorithms are
mostly based on deep-learning generative models and use the reconstruction
error to detect anomalies. They try to capture the distribution of normal data
by reconstructing normal data in the training phase, then calculate the
reconstruction error of test data to do anomaly detection. However, most of
them only use the normal data in the training phase and can not ensure the
reconstruction process of anomaly data. So, anomaly data can also be well
reconstructed sometimes and gets low reconstruction error, which leads to the
omission of anomalies. What's more, the neighbor information of data points in
time series data has not been fully utilized in these algorithms. In this
paper, we propose RAN based on the idea of Reconstruct Anomalies to Normal and
apply it for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. To minimize the
reconstruction error of normal data and maximize this of anomaly data, we do
not just ensure normal data to reconstruct well, but also try to make the
reconstruction of anomaly data consistent with the distribution of normal data,
then anomalies will get higher reconstruction errors. We implement this idea by
introducing the ""imitated anomaly data"" and combining a specially designed

estimators for the coefficients of AR processes are severely biased. This paper
suggests a model-based approach for bias correction of well-known estimators
for the coefficients of first and second-order stationary AR processes, taking
the sampling distribution of the original estimator into account. This is
achieved by modeling the relationship between the true and estimated AR
coefficients using weighted orthogonal polynomial regression, fitted to a huge
number of simulations. The finite-sample distributions of the new estimators
are approximated using transformations of skew-normal densities and their
properties are demonstrated by simulations and in the analysis of a real
ecological data set. The new estimators are easily available in our
accompanying R-package ARbiascorrect for time series of length n = 10, 11, ...

revealing similarities between time series that do not align perfectly. In this

effective in improving accuracy on a regression task when only a single
wavelength is considered. When combined with k-Nearest Neighbour, DTW has the
added advantage that it can reveal similarities and differences between samples
at the level of the time-series. However, in the problem, we consider here data
is available across a spectrum of wavelengths. If aggregate statistics (means,
variances) are used across many wavelengths the benefits of DTW are no longer

We develop a spectral domain method for multivariate second-order stationary
time series that linearly transforms the observed series into several groups of
lower-dimensional multivariate subseries. These multivariate subseries have
non-zero spectral coherence among components within a group but have zero
spectral coherence among components across groups. The observed series is
expressed as a sum of frequency components whose variances are proportional to
the spectral matrices at the respective frequencies. The demixing matrix is
then estimated using an eigendecomposition on the sum of the variance matrices
of these frequency components and its asymptotic properties are derived.
Finally, a consistent test on the cross-spectrum of pairs of components is used
to find the desired segmentation into the lower-dimensional subseries. The
numerical performance of the proposed method is illustrated through simulation

the most successful method employing unsupervised learning of multivariate time
series presented to date, but also that it exceeds the current state-of-the-art
performance of supervised methods; it does so even when the number of training

probabilistic models based on a variant of RNN called an echo state network

disturbances and a shrinkage prior for additional regularization. The second
approach employs the implicit copula of an ESN with Gaussian disturbances,
which is a deep copula process on the feature space. Combining this copula with
a non-parametrically estimated marginal distribution produces a deep
distributional time series model. The resulting probabilistic forecasts are
deep functions of the feature vector and also marginally calibrated. In both
approaches, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate the
models and compute forecasts. The proposed models are suitable for the complex
task of forecasting intraday electricity prices. Using data from the Australian
National Electricity Market, we show that our deep time series models provide
accurate short term probabilistic price forecasts, with the copula model

always been a methodological challenge and is an open problem. In this paper,
we propose a general Bayesian dimension reduction methodology for feature
selection in high-dimensional joint quantile time series analysis, under the
name of the quantile feature selection time series (QFSTS) model. The QFSTS
model is a general structural time series model, where each component yields an
additive contribution to the time series modeling with direct interpretations.
Its flexibility is compound in the sense that users can add/deduct components
for each time series and each time series can have its own specific valued
components of different sizes. Feature selection is conducted in the quantile
regression component, where each time series has its own pool of
contemporaneous external predictors allowing nowcasting. Bayesian methodology
in extending feature selection to the quantile time series research area is
developed using multivariate asymmetric Laplace distribution, spike-and-slab
prior setup, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the Bayesian model

containing data in the form of time series: health care (electrocardiogram,
blood sugar, etc.), activity recognition, remote sensing, finance (stock market

constructing algorithms dedicated to automatically label time series data. The
sequential aspect of time series data requires the development of algorithms

temporal dependency. However, forecasting on spatio-temporal data requires
modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition,
dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand
values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing
system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the
contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves
over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context
Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal,
relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead
demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various
geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a
demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one
for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series.
Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the
fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that
jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts

susceptibility to adversarial examples which also makes the DL regression
models for MTS forecasting also vulnerable to those attacks. To the best of our

models to adversarial time series examples, which is an important step,

methods for learning an appropriate graph time-series representation, modeling

methods for such data. While previous work on dynamic modeling and embedding
has focused on representing a stream of timestamped edges using a time-series
of graphs based on a specific time-scale (e.g., 1 month), we propose the notion
of an $\epsilon$-graph time-series that uses a fixed number of edges for each
graph, and show its superiority over the time-scale representation used in
previous work. In addition, we propose a number of new temporal models based on
the notion of temporal reachability graphs and weighted temporal summary
graphs. These temporal models are then used to generalize existing base
(static) embedding methods by enabling them to incorporate and appropriately
model temporal dependencies in the data. From the 6 temporal network models
investigated (for each of the 7 base embedding methods), we find that the top-3
temporal models are always those that leverage the new $\epsilon$-graph
time-series representation. Furthermore, the dynamic embedding methods from the
framework almost always achieve better predictive performance than existing

path leading to highest error is added as a new variable to the base model. In
this regard, our approach can be considered as an improvement over general time
series models since it enables incorporating nonlinear features by residuals

error most allows for interpretable results. The proposed approach extends to
probabilistic forecasting through generating prediction intervals based on the
empirical error distribution. We conduct a detailed numerical study with EBLR

predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks.
Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal
length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However,
real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of
observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of
predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model
for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly
observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed
model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative
adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that
receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The
discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed
values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing
elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps
(prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for

analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks,
and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of
potentially irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward
pass of a Neural CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path
space, often via interpolation, and using evaluations of this path to drive the
hidden state. Here, we use rough path theory to extend this formulation.
Instead of directly embedding into path space, we instead represent the input
signal over small time intervals through its \textit{log-signature}, which are
statistics describing how the signal drives a CDE. This is the approach for
solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs), and correspondingly we
describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural RDEs. This
extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a broader
class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling
long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length
up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements
in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing

four year-long monitoring campaign in and between the years 2014 and 2017, of
84 different rooms. The models are applicable for different time-series

kernel and reliable estimation of the hyperparameters. We propose a fixed
composition of kernels, which contains the components needed to model most time
series: linear trend, periodic patterns, and other flexible kernel for modeling
the non-linear trend. Not all components are necessary to model each time
series; during training the unnecessary components are automatically made
irrelevant via automatic relevance determination (ARD). We moreover assign
priors to the hyperparameters, in order to keep the inference within a
plausible range; we design such priors through an empirical Bayes approach. We
present results on many time series of different types; our GP model is more
accurate than state-of-the-art time series models. Thanks to the priors, a

Current state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning methods for anomaly
detection suffer from scalability and portability issues, and may have high
false positive rates. In this paper, we propose TadGAN, an unsupervised anomaly
detection approach built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To capture
the temporal correlations of time series distributions, we use LSTM Recurrent
Neural Networks as base models for Generators and Critics. TadGAN is trained
with cycle consistency loss to allow for effective time-series data
reconstruction. We further propose several novel methods to compute
reconstruction errors, as well as different approaches to combine
reconstruction errors and Critic outputs to compute anomaly scores. To
demonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach, we test
several anomaly scoring techniques and report the best-suited one. We compare
our approach to 8 baseline anomaly detection methods on 11 datasets from

Liu Sheng', 'Kensaku Kawamoto', 'Samir Abdelrahman']","Objective: To develop an effective and scalable individual-level patient cost
prediction method by automatically learning hidden temporal patterns from
multivariate time series data in patient insurance claims using a convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture.
  Methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to
2016 from a healthcare insurer, where data from the first two years were used
to build the model to predict costs in the third year. The data consisted of
the multivariate time series of cost, visit and medical features that were
shaped as images of patients' health status (i.e., matrices with time windows
on one dimension and the medical, visit and cost features on the other
dimension). Patients' multivariate time series images were given to a CNN
method with a proposed architecture. After hyper-parameter tuning, the proposed
architecture consisted of three building blocks of convolution and pooling
layers with an LReLU activation function and a customized kernel size at each
layer for healthcare data. The proposed CNN learned temporal patterns became
inputs to a fully connected layer.
  Conclusions: Feature learning through the proposed CNN configuration
significantly improved individual-level healthcare cost prediction. The
proposed CNN was able to outperform temporal pattern detection methods that
look for a pre-defined set of pattern shapes, since it is capable of extracting
a variable number of patterns with various shapes. Temporal patterns learned
from medical, visit and cost data made significant contributions to the
prediction performance. Hyper-parameter tuning showed that considering
three-month data patterns has the highest prediction accuracy. Our results
showed that patients' images extracted from multivariate time series data are
different from regular images, and hence require unique designs of CNN

utilise different kinds of discriminatory patterns. One of these groups
describes classifiers that predict using phase dependant intervals. The time
series forest (TSF) classifier is one of the most well known interval methods,
and has demonstrated strong performance as well as relative speed in training
and predictions. However, recent advances in other approaches have left TSF
behind. TSF originally summarises intervals using three simple summary
statistics. The `catch22' feature set of 22 time series features was recently
proposed to aid time series analysis through a concise set of diverse and
informative descriptive characteristics. We propose combining TSF and catch22
to form a new classifier, the Canonical Interval Forest (CIF). We outline
additional enhancements to the training procedure, and extend the classifier to
include multivariate classification capabilities. We demonstrate a large and
significant improvement in accuracy over both TSF and catch22, and show it to
be on par with top performers from other algorithmic classes. By upgrading the
interval-based component from TSF to CIF, we also demonstrate a significant
improvement in the hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based
ensembles (HIVE-COTE) that combines different time series representations.
HIVE-COTE using CIF is significantly more accurate on the UCR archive than any
other classifier we are aware of and represents a new state of the art for TSC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09172v1,cs.LG

Perepu', 'Bala Shyamala Balaji', 'Hemanth Kumar Tanneru', 'Sudhakar Kathari', 'Vivek Shankar Pinnamaraju']","Ensemble models are powerful model building tools that are developed with a
focus to improve the accuracy of model predictions. They find applications in
time series forecasting in varied scenarios including but not limited to
process industries, health care, and economics where a single model might not
provide optimal performance. It is known that if models selected for data
modelling are distinct (linear/non-linear, static/dynamic) and independent
(minimally correlated models), the accuracy of the predictions is improved.
Various approaches suggested in the literature to weigh the ensemble models use
a static set of weights. Due to this limitation, approaches using a static set
of weights for weighing ensemble models cannot capture the dynamic changes or
local features of the data effectively. To address this issue, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL) approach to dynamically assign and update weights of each of the
models at different time instants depending on the nature of data and the
individual model predictions is proposed in this work. The RL method
implemented online, essentially learns to update the weights and reduce the
errors as the time progresses. Simulation studies on time series data showed
that the dynamic weighted approach using RL learns the weight better than
existing approaches. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with an
existing approach of online Neural Network tuning quantitatively through
normalized mean square error(NMSE) values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08878v1,cs.LG

relations among variables in MTS, including static, dynamic, predictable, and
latent relations, have made it possible to mining more features of MTS.
Modeling complex relations are not only essential in characterizing latent
dependency as well as modeling temporal dependence but also brings great
challenges in the MTS forecasting task. However, existing methods mainly focus
on modeling certain relations among MTS variables. In this paper, we propose a
novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed Multivariate Time Series
Forecasting via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (MTHetGNN). To characterize
complex relations among variables, a relation embedding module is designed in
MTHetGNN, where each variable is regarded as a graph node, and each type of
edge represents a specific static or dynamic relationship. Meanwhile, a
temporal embedding module is introduced for time series features extraction,
where involving convolutional neural network (CNN) filters with different
perception scales. Finally, a heterogeneous graph embedding module is adopted
to handle the complex structural information generated by the two modules.

Reasonable prediction results can assist people in planning and
decision-making, generate benefits and avoid risks. Normally, there are two
characteristics of time series, that is, long-term trend and short-term
fluctuation. For example, stock prices will have a long-term upward trend with
the market, but there may be a small decline in the short term. These two
characteristics are often relatively independent of each other. However, the
existing prediction methods often do not distinguish between them, which
reduces the accuracy of the prediction model. In this paper, a MTS forecasting
framework that can capture the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of
time series in parallel is proposed. This method uses the original time series
and its first difference to characterize long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations. Three prediction sub-networks are constructed to predict
long-term trends, short-term fluctuations and the final value to be predicted.
In the overall optimization goal, the idea of multi-task learning is used for
reference, which is to make the prediction results of long-term trends and
short-term fluctuations as close to the real values as possible while requiring
to approximate the values to be predicted. In this way, the proposed method
uses more supervision information and can more accurately capture the changing
trend of the time series, thereby improving the forecasting performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07730v3,cs.LG

Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising results in

implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), which require a sufficient amount of time series to estimate
their numerous model parameters. However, many time series databases have only
a limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data

three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS, moving block bootstrap
(MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA) to synthetically
generate a collection of time series. The knowledge acquired from these
augmented time series is then transferred to the original dataset using two
different approaches: the pooled approach and the transfer learning approach.
When building GFMs, in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented
time series alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer

we pay attention to the proportion of variation, which decides the number of
principal components (PCs), and the loadings, which help interpret the meaning

forecasting the demand for multiple products offered by a retailer or server
loads within a data center. The local approach to this problem considers each
time series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global
approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time
series, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However,
recent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous
datasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods,
potentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study.
  Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and
global methods, we provide the following contributions:
  1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can
produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the
series. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously
thought.
  2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The
complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains
constant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford
to be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds
serve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and
guide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models,
this implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods.
  3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from
these principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in
superior accuracy.

structured regularization method for completing both phases simultaneously. The

different data dimensions often share similar temporal patterns but may exhibit
distinct magnitudes, and hence allowing the superposition of all sub-sequences
to exhibit diverse behaviors at different data dimensions. We further
generalize the proposed model by replacing the Gaussian observation layer with
the negative binomial distribution to model multivariate count time series.
Generated from the proposed GGP is an infinite dimensional directed sparse
random graph, which is constructed by taking the logical OR operation of
countably infinite binary adjacency matrices that share the same set of
countably infinite nodes. Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a
weight to indicate its activation strength, and places a finite number of edges
between a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same node community. We use
the generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to
define both the sparsity pattern and dimension of the latent state transition
matrix of a (generalized) linear dynamical system. The activation strength of
each node community relative to the overall activation strength is used to
extract a multivariate sub-sequence, revealing the data pattern captured by the
corresponding community. On both synthetic and real-world time series, the

data modeling and sharing. Due to the high dimensionality of clinical time
series, adequate de-identification to preserve privacy while retaining data
utility is difficult to achieve using common de-identification techniques. An
innovative approach to this problem is synthetic data generation. From a
technical perspective, a good generative model for time-series data should
preserve temporal dynamics, in the sense that new sequences respect the
original relationships between high-dimensional variables across time. From the
privacy perspective, the model should prevent patient re-identification by
limiting vulnerability to membership inference attacks. The NeurIPS 2020
Hide-and-Seek Privacy Challenge is a novel two-tracked competition to
simultaneously accelerate progress in tackling both problems. In our
head-to-head format, participants in the synthetic data generation track (i.e.
""hiders"") and the patient re-identification track (i.e. ""seekers"") are directly
pitted against each other by way of a new, high-quality intensive care

features to model the patterns and a conditional neural field to model the
temporal correlations among the time regions. We evaluated the performance of
Shape-CD using four highly dynamic time-series datasets, including the
ExtraSensory dataset with up to 2000 classes. Shape-CD demonstrated improved

Shamim Hossain']","Since edge device failures (i.e., anomalies) seriously affect the production
of industrial products in Industrial IoT (IIoT), accurately and timely
detecting anomalies is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, data
collected by the edge device may contain the user's private data, which is
challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the
public concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new
communication-efficient on-device federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly
detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we
first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to
collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its
generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based
Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to
accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention
mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby
preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this
model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data.
Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly
detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-\textit{k}
selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately
and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50\%

for extracting relevant patterns from several assets combined together. In this
research we are focusing on translating the specific asset-based historical

the main reason. Information-theoretical arguments show that effect size can
often be increased if causal parents are included in the conditioning sets. To
identify parents early on, we suggest an iterative procedure that utilizes
novel orientation rules to determine ancestral relationships already during the
edge removal phase. We prove that the method is order-independent, and sound
and complete in the oracle case. Extensive simulation studies for different

series. An attractive feature of the periodogram is that the expectation of the
periodogram is approximately equal to the underlying spectral density of the
time series. However, this is only an approximation, and it is well known that
the periodogram has a finite sample bias, which can be severe in small samples.
In this paper, we show that the bias arises because of the finite boundary of
observation in one of the discrete Fourier transforms which is used in the
construction of the periodogram. Moreover, we show that by using the best
linear predictors of the time series over the boundary of observation we can
obtain a ""complete periodogram"" that is an unbiased estimator of the spectral
density. In practice, the ""complete periodogram"" cannot be evaluated as the
best linear predictors are unknown. We propose a method for estimating the best
linear predictors and prove that the resulting ""estimated complete periodogram""
has a smaller bias than the regular periodogram. The estimated complete
periodogram and a tapered version of it are used to estimate parameters, which
can be represented in terms of the integrated spectral density. We prove that

on an important challenge that is at the core of time series causal discovery:
regime-dependent causal relations. Often dynamical systems feature transitions
depending on some, often persistent, unobserved background regime, and
different regimes may exhibit different causal relations. Here, we assume a
persistent and discrete regime variable leading to a finite number of regimes

PCMCI allows for linear and nonlinear, high-dimensional time series causal
discovery. Our method, Regime-PCMCI, is evaluated on a number of numerical

they encounter samples from a new underlying causal graph. However, these
samples often share relevant information which is lost when following this
approach. Specifically, different samples may share the dynamics which describe
the effects of their causal relations. We propose Amortized Causal Discovery, a
novel framework that leverages such shared dynamics to learn to infer causal
relations from time-series data. This enables us to train a single, amortized
model that infers causal relations across samples with different underlying
causal graphs, and thus leverages the shared dynamics information. We
demonstrate experimentally that this approach, implemented as a variational
model, leads to significant improvements in causal discovery performance, and
show how it can be extended to perform well under added noise and hidden
confounding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10833v3,cs.LG

essential application in many domains. Modern time series collected from sensor
networks (e.g., energy consumption and traffic flow) are often large-scale and
incomplete with considerable corruption and missing values, making it difficult
to perform accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a low-rank
autoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework to model multivariate time
series data. The key of LATC is to transform the original multivariate time
series matrix (e.g., sensor$\times$time point) to a third-order tensor
structure (e.g., sensor$\times$time of day$\times$day) by introducing an
additional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms
and seasonality of time series as global patterns. With the tensor structure,
we can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation
problems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides
minimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the
original matrix representation into the objective function. The two components
serve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture
the global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e.,
similarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s.
the same time of historical days). The autoregressive norm can better model the
local temporal trends. Our numerical experiments on three real-world data sets
demonstrate the superiority of the integration of global and local trends in
LATC in both missing data imputation and rolling prediction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10436v1,stat.ML

building a complex causality graph. However, the traditional Granger causality
method assumes that the causalities lie between time series channels and remain
constant, which cannot model the real-world time series data with dynamic
causalities along the time series channels. In this paper, we present the
dynamic window-level Granger causality method (DWGC) for multi-channel time
series data. We build the causality model on the window-level by doing the
F-test with the forecasting errors on the sliding windows. We propose the
causality indexing trick in our DWGC method to reweight the original time
series data. Essentially, the causality indexing is to decrease the
auto-correlation and increase the cross-correlation causal effects, which
improves the DWGC method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on two
synthetic and one real-world datasets show that the improved DWGC method with
causality indexing better detects the window-level causalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07788v1,stat.ME

flexible continuous-time stochastic recurrent neural network named Variational
Stochastic Differential Networks (VSDN), which embeds the complicated dynamics
of the sporadic time series by neural Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE).
VSDNs capture the stochastic dependency among latent states and observations by

generating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.
However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint
probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long
time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the
conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We
propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating
Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path
feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a
graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a
stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series
model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that
captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a
discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation
of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive
training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and

Attention is paid to the different sparsity assumptions imposed on the VAR

brief, by using basis functions over a continuous state space, DDD allows for

a result continuously maps between distributions. The number of parameters in
DDD scales by the square of the number of basis functions; we reformulate the

inference of sparse matrices only -- hence reducing the number of parameters.
Finally, we demonstrate how DDD is suitable to integrate both trajectory time
series (paired between subsequent time points) and snapshot time series

outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural
networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity

improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these
properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their
dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in
latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction

the vanishing or exploding of the gradient during training. This phenomenon is
expressed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation of the

Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model in forecasting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Time
series of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day,
3-day, and 5-day forecasts using several LSTM models and ARIMA. Two novel
k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and
k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the
performance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days.
Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as
0.05%, while those for ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models
slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the
forecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting
COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform
reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a
large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period

discriminative shapelets. In particular, the generated dual prototypical
shapelets consist of representative samples that can mostly demonstrate the
overall shapes of all samples in the class and discriminative partial-length

coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base

decade, with many new classification approaches published each year. Prior
research has mostly focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of
classifiers, with interpretability being somewhat neglected. This aspect of
classifiers has become critical for many application domains and the
introduction of the EU GDPR legislation in 2018 is likely to further emphasize
the importance of interpretable learning algorithms. Currently,
state-of-the-art classification accuracy is achieved with very complex models

pre-processing of the original series to a set fixed-length. In this paper we

approach is based on symbolic representations of time series, efficient
sequence mining algorithms and linear classification models. Our linear models
are as accurate as deep learning models but are more efficient regarding
running time and memory, can work with variable-length time series and can be

having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we
extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case

Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train
efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time
formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet

demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be
generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating

due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend the
comparison to neural ODEs for time-series regression and CNFs. Unlike in
classification, meaningful models in these tasks must also satisfy additional
requirements beyond accurate final-time output, e.g., the invertibility of the
CNF. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful
numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as
Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced

explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess
the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based
neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies,
Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes
uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while
at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our
experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow
signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we
observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator
imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the
uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models
and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general,
while improving robustness of signature models in particular.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12359v2,cs.LG

researchers from a diverse range of fields including economics, finance, and
traffic. A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that
its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to
say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies
between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks
(GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs
require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means
they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the
dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general
graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time
series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations
among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge
like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation
layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial
and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph
convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an
end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets

new problem domains. However, robust techniques have not yet been considered
for time series data with varying amounts of data availability. In this paper,
we make three main contributions to fill this gap. First, we propose a novel
Convolutional deep Domain Adaptation model for Time Series data (CoDATS) that
significantly improves accuracy and training time over state-of-the-art DA
strategies on real-world sensor data benchmarks. By utilizing data from
multiple source domains, we increase the usefulness of CoDATS to further
improve accuracy over prior single-source methods, particularly on complex time
series datasets that have high variability between domains. Second, we propose
a novel Domain Adaptation with Weak Supervision (DA-WS) method by utilizing
weak supervision in the form of target-domain label distributions, which may be
easier to collect than additional data labels. Third, we perform comprehensive
experiments on diverse real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our
domain adaptation and weak supervision methods. Results show that CoDATS for
single-source DA significantly improves over the state-of-the-art methods, and
we achieve additional improvements in accuracy using data from multiple source
domains and weakly supervised signals. Code is available at:

advancements in recent years, especially in data-abundant settings and with the
central aim of learning global models that can extract patterns across multiple
time series. While the crucial importance of appropriate data pre-processing
and scaling has often been noted in prior work, most studies focus on improving
model architectures. In this paper we empirically investigate the effect of
data input and output transformations on the predictive performance of several
neural forecasting architectures. In particular, we investigate the
effectiveness of several forms of data binning, i.e. converting real-valued
time series into categorical ones, when combined with feed-forward, recurrent
neural networks, and convolution-based sequence models. In many non-forecasting
applications where these models have been very successful, the model inputs and
outputs are categorical (e.g. words from a fixed vocabulary in natural language
processing applications or quantized pixel color intensities in computer
vision). For forecasting applications, where the time series are typically
real-valued, various ad-hoc data transformations have been proposed, but have
not been systematically compared. To remedy this, we evaluate the forecasting
accuracy of instances of the aforementioned model classes when combined with
different types of data scaling and binning. We find that binning almost always
improves performance (compared to using normalized real-valued inputs), but
that the particular type of binning chosen is of lesser importance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10111v1,cs.LG

a family of non-myopic algorithms which try to anticipate the expected future
gain in information in balance with the cost of waiting. In one class of
algorithms, unsupervised-based, the expectations use the clustering of time
series, while in a second class, supervised-based, time series are grouped

Extensive experiments carried out on real data sets using a large range of
delay cost functions show that the presented algorithms are able to
satisfactorily solving the earliness vs. accuracy trade-off, with the

to answer the following questions: (i)~can ODE be used to redefine the existing
neural network model? (ii)~can Neural ODEs solve the irregular sampling rate
challenge of existing neural network models for a continuous time series, i.e.,
length and dynamic nature, (iii)~how to reduce the training and evaluation time
of existing Neural ODE systems? This work leverages the mathematical foundation
of ODEs to redesign traditional RNNs such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The main contribution of this paper is to
illustrate the design of two new ODE-based RNN models (GRU-ODE model and
LSTM-ODE) which can compute the hidden state and cell state at any point of
time using an ODE solver. These models reduce the computation overhead of
hidden state and cell state by a vast amount. The performance evaluation of
these two new models for learning continuous time series with irregular

continuous time series, where the value for one or more observations at
different time points are missing. Such missing observations are one of the
major limitations of time series processing using deep learning. Practical
applications, e.g., sensor data, healthcare, weather, generates data that is in
truth continuous in time, and informative missingness is a common phenomenon in
these datasets. These datasets often consist of multiple variables, and often
there are missing values for one or many of these variables. This
characteristic makes time series prediction more challenging, and the impact of
missing input observations on the accuracy of the final output can be
significant. A recent novel deep learning model called GRU-D is one early
attempt to address informative missingness in time series data. On the other
hand, a new family of neural networks called Neural ODEs (Ordinary Differential
Equations) are natural and efficient for processing time series data which is
continuous in time. In this paper, a deep learning model is proposed that

been applied to the time series. Inspired by the success of deep learning
methods in computer vision, several studies have proposed transforming time
series into image-like representations, used as inputs for deep learning
models, and have led to very promising results in classification tasks. In this
paper, we first review the signal to image encoding approaches found in the

formulations to make them more robust to the variability in large datasets.
Third, we compare them on the basis of a common unsupervised task to
demonstrate how the choice of the encoding can impact the results when used in
the same deep learning architecture. We thus provide a comparison between six

encoding methods are Gramian Angular Field, Markov Transition Field, recurrence

high-dimensional unit-root time series by postulating that a $p$-dimensional
unit-root process is a nonsingular linear transformation of a set of unit-root
processes, a set of stationary common factors, which are dynamically dependent,
and some idiosyncratic white noise components. For the stationary components,
we assume that the factor process captures the temporal-dependence and the
idiosyncratic white noise series explains, jointly with the factors, the
cross-sectional dependence. The estimation of nonsingular linear loading spaces
is carried out in two steps. First, we use an eigenanalysis of a nonnegative
definite matrix of the data to separate the unit-root processes from the
stationary ones and a modified method to specify the number of unit roots. We
then employ another eigenanalysis and a projected principal component analysis
to identify the stationary common factors and the white noise series. We
propose a new procedure to specify the number of white noise series and, hence,
the number of stationary common factors, establish asymptotic properties of the
proposed method for both fixed and diverging $p$ as the sample size $n$
increases, and use simulation and a real example to demonstrate the performance
of the proposed method in finite samples. We also compare our method with some

data. Intuitively, effective CPD over multivariate time series should require
explicit modeling of the dependencies across input variables. However, existing
CPD methods either ignore the dependency structures entirely or rely on the
(unrealistic) assumption that the correlation structures are static over time.
In this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Dynamics Model for CPD, which
explicitly models the correlation structure and dynamics of variables by
incorporating graph neural networks into an encoder-decoder framework.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
advantageous performance of the proposed model on CPD tasks over strong

of sensors over a network of time series for the purpose of signal recovery at
non-observed sensors with a minimal reconstruction error. The problem is
motivated by applications where time-dependent graph signals are collected over
redundant networks. In this setting, one may wish to only use a subset of
sensors to predict data streams over the whole collection of nodes in the
underlying graph. A typical application is the possibility to reduce the power
consumption in a network of sensors that may have limited battery supplies. We
propose and compare various data-driven strategies to turn off a fixed number
of sensors or equivalently to select a sampling set of nodes. We also relate
our approach to the existing literature on sensor selection from multivariate
data with a (possibly) underlying graph structure. Our methodology combines
tools from multivariate time series analysis, graph signal processing,
statistical learning in high-dimension and deep learning. To illustrate the
performances of our approach, we report numerical experiments on the analysis

quasi-likelihood approach driven by a latent factor process. More specifically,
given the latent process, we only specify the conditional mean and variance of
the time series and enjoy a quasi-likelihood function for estimating parameters

(i) no parametric form is assumed for the conditional distribution of the time
series given the latent process; (ii) able for modelling non-negative, count,
bounded/binary and real-valued time series; (iii) dispersion parameter is not
assumed to be known. Further, we obtain explicit expressions for the marginal
moments and for the autocorrelation function of the time series process so that
a method of moments can be employed for estimating the dispersion parameter and
also parameters related to the latent process. Simulated results aiming to
check the proposed estimation procedure are presented. Real data analysis on

classification is becoming increasingly important in civil engineering as a
result of continued long-term health monitoring of a large number of
engineering structures encompassing buildings, bridges, towers, and offshore
platforms. In this context, this paper proposes the application of a relatively
new time series representation named ""Shapelet transform"", which is based on
local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration
of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake,
wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new
shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation
with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly ""white-box"" machine
learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent
algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of
domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The
efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection
procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake
events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses
in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between
near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from
continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced

importance that the broader scientific community is currently facing. One of
the main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19
case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are
currently in the ""exponential spread stage,"" and thus there is scarce
information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition
between spread and containment.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of
COVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix
factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the
same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the
dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their
interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09112v1,cs.LG

of their success is due to generalization from using large datasets. However,
unlike other domains, time series classification datasets are often small. In
order to address this problem, we propose a novel time series data augmentation
called guided warping. While many data augmentation methods are based on random
transformations, guided warping exploits the element alignment properties of
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and shapeDTW, a high-level DTW method based on shape
descriptors, to deterministically warp sample patterns. In this way, the time
series are mixed by warping the features of a sample pattern to match the time
steps of a reference pattern. Furthermore, we introduce a discriminative
teacher in order to serve as a directed reference for the guided warping. We
evaluate the method on all 85 datasets in the 2015 UCR Time Series Archive with

simple reason that there is no kernel designed to represent them and their
unique characteristics in full generality. Existing sequential kernels ignore
the time indices, with many assuming that the series must be regularly-spaced;
some such kernels are not even psd. In this manuscript, we show that a ""series
kernel"" that is general enough to represent irregularly-spaced multivariate
time series may be built out of well-known ""vector kernels"". We also show that
all series kernels constructed using our methodology are psd, and are thus
widely applicable. We demonstrate this point by formulating a Gaussian
process-based strategy - with our series kernel at its heart - to make
predictions about test series when given a training set. We validate the
strategy experimentally by estimating its generalisation error on multiple
datasets and comparing it to relevant baselines. We also demonstrate that our

data such as clustering, classification and anomaly detection. Even though many
papers have addressed the problem of how to find motifs in time-series by
proposing new motif discovery algorithms, not much work has been done on the
exploration of the motifs extracted by these algorithms. In this paper, we
argue that visually exploring time-series motifs computed by motif discovery
algorithms can be useful to understand and debug results. To explore the output
of motif discovery algorithms, we propose the use of an adapted Self-Organizing
Map, the DTW-SOM, on the list of motif's centers. In short, DTW-SOM is a
vanilla Self-Organizing Map with three main differences, namely (1) the use the
Dynamic Time Warping distance instead of the Euclidean distance, (2) the
adoption of two new network initialization routines (a random sample
initialization and an anchor initialization) and (3) the adjustment of the
Adaptation phase of the training to work with variable-length time-series
sequences. We test DTW-SOM in a synthetic motif dataset and two real
time-series datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. After an
exploration of results, we conclude that DTW-SOM is capable of extracting

functional cross-spectral stability measure to characterize the effect of
dependence on these estimated cross terms, which are essential in the estimates
for additive functional linear regressions. With the proposed functional
cross-spectral stability measure, we develop useful concentration inequalities
for estimated cross-(auto)covariance matrix functions to accommodate more
general sub-Gaussian functional linear processes and, furthermore, establish
finite sample theory for relevant estimated terms under a commonly adopted
functional principal component analysis framework. Using our derived

researchers in the last few years. One main challenge in TSC is the diversity
of domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no ""one model that
fits all"" in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific
type of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target
the existence/non-existence of specific patterns/shapelets. Yet other
techniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating
patterns/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that
addresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method.
The technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through ""compound
eyes"" that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each
ommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a
broad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses
and representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for
broader visibility. These lenses have been created through
hyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and
Fourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens,
then performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most
confident eyes, i.e, forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye,
using the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more
than 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits
of bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and
robustness of Co-eye in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06668v2,cs.LG

obtain accurate and reliable covariance structure. Finally, OHIT generates the

approaches to data analysis. These techniques have transformed traditional data
mining-based analysis radically into a learning-based model in which existing
data sets along with their cluster labels (i.e., train set) are learned to
build a supervised learning model and predict the cluster labels of unseen data
(i.e., test set). In particular, deep learning techniques are capable of
capturing and learning hidden features in a given data sets and thus building a
more accurate prediction model for clustering and labeling problem. However,
the major problem is that time series data are often unlabeled and thus
supervised learning-based deep learning algorithms cannot be directly adapted
to solve the clustering problems for these special and complex types of data
sets. To address this problem, this paper introduces a two-stage method for
clustering time series data. First, a novel technique is introduced to utilize
the characteristics (e.g., volatility) of given time series data in order to
create labels and thus be able to transform the problem from unsupervised
learning into supervised learning. Second, an autoencoder-based deep learning
model is built to learn and model both known and hidden features of time series
data along with their created labels to predict the labels of unseen time
series data. The paper reports a case study in which financial and stock time
series data of selected 70 stock indices are clustered into distinct groups

procedure is capable of achieving 87.5\% accuracy in clustering and predicting
the labels for unseen time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07296v1,cs.LG

capacity to characterize the non-linear partial autocorrelation structure of
time series and directly capture dynamic effects such as seasonality and
trends. Application of exponentially smoothed RNNs to forecasting electricity
load, weather data, and stock prices highlight the efficacy of exponential
smoothing of the hidden state for multi-step time series forecasting. The
results also suggest that popular, but more complicated neural network
architectures originally designed for speech processing, such as LSTMs and
GRUs, are likely over-engineered for industrial forecasting and light-weight
exponentially smoothed architectures, trained in a fraction of the time,
capture the salient features while being superior and more robust than simple

autoregressive representation of the time-reversed series of Fourier

process. It generates backward-in-time, functional replicates that adequately
mimic the dependence structure of the underlying process in a model-free way
and have the same conditionally fixed curves at the end of each functional
pseudo-time series. The bootstrap prediction error distribution is then
calculated as the difference between the model-free, bootstrap-generated future
functional observations and the functional forecasts obtained from the model
used for prediction. This allows the estimated prediction error distribution to
account for the innovation and estimation errors associated with prediction and
the possible errors due to model misspecification. We establish the asymptotic
validity of the bootstrap procedure in estimating the conditional prediction
error distribution of interest, and we also show that the procedure enables the
construction of prediction bands that achieve (asymptotically) the desired
coverage. Prediction bands based on a consistent estimation of the conditional

significant importance in the research community, but not much research has
been done on generating adversarial samples for these models. Such samples of
adversaries could become a security concern. In this paper, we propose
transforming the existing adversarial transformation network (ATN) on a
distilled model to attack various multivariate time series classification
models. The proposed attack on the classification model utilizes a distilled
model as a surrogate that mimics the behavior of the attacked classical
multivariate time series classification models. The proposed methodology is
tested onto 1-Nearest Neighbor Dynamic Time Warping (1-NN DTW) and a Fully
Convolutional Network (FCN), all of which are trained on 18 University of East
Anglia (UEA) and University of California Riverside (UCR) datasets. We show
both models were susceptible to attacks on all 18 datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, adversarial attacks have only been conducted in the domain of
univariate time series and have not been conducted on multivariate time series.
such an attack on time series classification models has never been done before.
Additionally, we recommend future researchers that develop time series
classification models to incorporating adversarial data samples into their
training data sets to improve resilience on adversarial samples and to consider
model robustness as an evaluative metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00410v1,cs.LG

correlator was responsible for most of our gains over the naive constant
forecasting method. We identify data leakage as one reason for its success,

Brownian bridge. This insight allows us to make ABBA essentially
parameter-free, except for the approximation tolerance which must be chosen.
Extensive comparisons with the SAX and 1d-SAX representations are included in

is generated by non-stationary phenomena, the pattern relating the series with
the class to be predicted may evolve over time (concept drift). Consequently,
predictive models aimed to learn this pattern may become eventually obsolete,
hence failing to sustain performance levels of practical use. To overcome this
model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data
samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data
stream by implementing assorted concept drift strategies. In this manuscript we
elaborate on the suitability of online learning methods to predict the road
congestion level based on traffic speed time series data. We draw interesting
insights on the performance degradation when the forecasting horizon is
increased. As opposed to what is done in most literature, we provide evidence
of the importance of assessing the distribution of classes over time before
designing and tuning the learning model. This previous exercise may give a hint
of the predictability of the different congestion levels under target.
Experimental results are discussed over real traffic speed data captured by
inductive loops deployed over Seattle (USA). Several online learning methods
are analyzed, from traditional incremental learning algorithms to more
elaborated deep learning models. As shown by the reported results, when
increasing the prediction horizon, the performance of all models degrade
severely due to the distribution of classes along time, which supports our
claim about the importance of analyzing this distribution prior to the design
of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14304v1,cs.LG

sales forecasting for business, rainfall forecasting for agriculture and many
others. Though this problem has been extensively studied for years, it is still
considered a challenging problem due to complex and evolving nature of time
series data. Typical methods proposed for time series forecasting modeled
linear or non-linear dependencies between data observations. However it is a
generally accepted notion that no one method is universally effective for all
kinds of time series data. Attempts have been made to use dynamic and weighted
combination of heterogeneous and independent forecasting models and it has been
found to be a promising direction to tackle this problem. This method is based
on the assumption that different forecasters have different specialization and
varying performance for different distribution of data and weights are
dynamically assigned to multiple forecasters accordingly. However in many
practical time series data-set, the distribution of data slowly evolves with
time. We propose to employ a re-weighting based method to adjust the assigned
weights to various forecasters in order to account for such distribution-drift.

been proposed, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their
performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on
simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable
ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the
comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing
yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important
to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this,
we present a data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point
detection algorithms that consists of 37 time series from various application
domains. Each series was annotated by five human annotators to provide ground
truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency
of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to
measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth

methods for time series prediction did not involve additional information. With
a lot of dynamic knowledge graphs available, we can use this additional
information to predict the time series better. Recently, there has been a focus
on the application of deep representation learning on dynamic graphs. These
methods predict the structure of the graph by reasoning over the interactions

to incorporate the information from dynamic knowledge graphs for time series
prediction. We show that if the information contained in the graph and the time
series data are closely related, then this inter-dependence can be used to
predict the time series with improved accuracy. Our framework, DArtNet, learns
a static embedding for every node in the graph as well as a dynamic embedding
which is dependent on the dynamic attribute value (time-series). Then it
captures the information from the neighborhood by taking a relation specific
mean and encodes the history information using RNN. We jointly train the model
link prediction and attribute prediction. We evaluate our method on five

understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis
tests that are used to determine statistically significant directed or
multivariate relationships from time-series data often yield spurious
associations (Type I errors) or omit causal relationships (Type II errors).
This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or
prewhitening approaches), and instead that the degrees of freedom in
statistical tests should be altered to account for the effective sample size
induced by cross-correlations in the observations. This insight enabled us to
derive modified hypothesis tests for any multivariate correlation-based
measures of linear dependence between covariance-stationary time series,
including Granger causality and mutual information with Gaussian marginals. We
use both numerical simulations (generated by autoregressive models and digital
filtering) as well as recorded fMRI-neuroimaging data to show that our tests
are unbiased for a variety of stationary time series. Our experiments
demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and
without prewhitening of the signals. These findings suggest that many
dependencies reported in the scientific literature may have been, and may
continue to be, spuriously reported or missed if modified hypothesis tests are

observational time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based
methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks
suffer from low recall and partially inflated false positives for strong
autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel
method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of
contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability of CI tests by
optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle
case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has
higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false
positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than
the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be of considerable use in many real world

example: $\rho(x)\propto \exp(-|(x-\mu)/\sigma|^\kappa/\kappa)$ exponential
power distribution (EPD) family, which covers wide range of tail behavior like
Gaussian ($\kappa=2$) or Laplace ($\kappa=1$) distribution. It is also

measurements collected over time, such as lab tests and vital signs, which
provide important information about a patient's health status. These sequences
of clinical measurements are naturally represented as time series,
characterized by multiple variables and large amounts of missing data, which
complicate the analysis. In this work, we propose a novel kernel which is
capable of exploiting both the information from the observed values as well the
information hidden in the missing patterns in multivariate time series (MTS)
originating e.g. from EHRs. The kernel, called TCK$_{IM}$, is designed using an
ensemble learning strategy in which the base models are novel mixed mode
Bayesian mixture models which can effectively exploit informative missingness
without having to resort to imputation methods. Moreover, the ensemble approach
ensures robustness to hyperparameters and therefore TCK$_{IM}$ is particularly
well suited if there is a lack of labels - a known challenge in medical
applications. Experiments on three real-world clinical datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed kernel.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12359v1,stat.ML

first, multi-way delay embedding transform (MDT) is employed to represent time
series as low-rank block Hankel tensors (BHT). Then, the higher-order tensors
are projected to compressed core tensors by applying Tucker decomposition. At
the same time, the generalized tensor Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) is explicitly used on consecutive core tensors to predict future
samples. In this manner, the proposed approach tactically incorporates the
unique advantages of MDT tensorization (to exploit mutual correlations) and
tensor ARIMA coupled with low-rank Tucker decomposition into a unified
framework. This framework exploits the low-rank structure of block Hankel
tensors in the embedded space and captures the intrinsic correlations among
multiple TS, which thus can improve the forecasting results, especially for
multiple short time series. Experiments conducted on three public datasets and

provides a fixed-length, robust summarization of the variable-length time
series. Many classical machine learning methods for classification and
regression depend on data instances with a fixed number of features. As a
result, those methods cannot be directly applied to variable-length time series
data. One common approach is to perform classification over a sliding window on
the data and aggregate the decisions made at local sections of the time series
in some way, through majority voting for classification or averaging for
regression. The downside to this approach is that minority local information is
lost in the voting process and averaging assumes that each time series
measurement is equal in significance. Also, since time series can be of varying
length, the quality of votes and averages could vary greatly in cases where
there is a close voting tie or bimodal distribution of regression domain.
Summarization conducted by the \textit{SummerTime} method will be a
fixed-length feature vector which can be used in-place of the time series
dataset for use with classical machine learning methods. We use Gaussian
Mixture models (GMM) over small same-length disjoint windows in the time series

cluster will be a feature in the summarization. The model is naturally capable
of converging to an appropriate cluster count. We compare our results to

encoder network to maximize the mutual information between the latent variables

well suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple
parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we
model the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive
deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a

topic. In this paper, we extend the method of Chang et al. (2017) to
matrix-valued time series. For any given $p\times q$ matrix-valued time series,
we look for linear transformations to segment the matrix into many small
sub-matrices for which each of them are uncorrelated with the others both
contemporaneously and serially, thus they can be analyzed separately, which
will greatly reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in terms of
modeling. To overcome the identification issue, we propose a two-step and more
structured procedure to segment the rows and columns separately. When
$\max(p,q)$ is large in relation to the sample size $n$, we assume the
transformation matrices are sparse and use threshold estimators for the
(auto)covariance matrices. We also propose a block-wisely thresholding method
to separate the columns (or rows) of the transformed matrix-valued data. The
asymptotic properties are established for both fixed and diverging $\max(p,q)$.
Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) for independent data, we cannot

identifying time series that carry information on event occurrences without

of a prior distribution on segment length. Given the segmentation, the model
can be viewed as a variant of a Gaussian mixture model where the mixture

the effectiveness of our model on synthetic data as well as on real time-series

because many real-world phenomena can be modeled as time series. The massive
volume of data and recent advancements in the processing power of the computers

propose various neural network architectures to forecast the time series data
using the dynamic measurements; moreover, we introduce various architectures on
how to combine static and dynamic measurements for forecasting. We also
investigate the importance of performing techniques such as anomaly detection
and clustering on forecasting accuracy. Our results indicate that clustering
can improve the overall prediction time as well as improve the forecasting
performance of the neural network. Furthermore, we show that feature-based
clustering can outperform the distance-based clustering in terms of speed and

introduced in different fields such as network monitoring, fraud detection, and
intrusion detection. However, they require understanding of data pattern and
often need a long off-line period to build a model or network for the target
data. Providing real-time and proactive anomaly detection for streaming time
series without human intervention and domain knowledge is highly valuable since
it greatly reduces human effort and enables appropriate countermeasures to be
undertaken before a disastrous damage, failure, or other harmful event occurs.
However, this issue has not been well studied yet. To address it, this paper
proposes RePAD, which is a Real-time Proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for
streaming time series based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). RePAD utilizes
short-term historic data points to predict and determine whether or not the
upcoming data point is a sign that an anomaly is likely to happen in the near
future. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold over time, RePAD is
able to tolerate minor pattern change in time series and detect anomalies
either proactively or on time. Experiments based on two time series datasets
collected from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark demonstrate that RePAD is able to
proactively detect anomalies and provide early warnings in real time without
human intervention and domain knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08922v8,cs.LG

Fully Convolution Network (FCN) as the classifier, MDF demonstrates the
superior performance on the UCR time series dataset in benchmark with other
time series classification methods. It is interesting to find that the triadic
time series motifs give the best result in the test. Due to the motif
clustering reflected in MDF, the significant motifs are detected with the help
of the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The areas in MDF

frequency domain methods. The aim of this paper is to draw connections between
frequency and time domain methods. Our focus will be on reconciling the
Gaussian likelihood and the Whittle likelihood. We derive an exact,
interpretable, bound between the Gaussian and Whittle likelihood of a second
order stationary time series. The derivation is based on obtaining the
transformation which is biorthogonal to the discrete Fourier transform of the
time series. Such a transformation yields a new decomposition for the inverse
of a Toeplitz matrix and enables the representation of the Gaussian likelihood
within the frequency domain. We show that the difference between the Gaussian
and Whittle likelihood is due to the omission of the best linear predictions
outside the domain of observation in the periodogram associated with the
Whittle likelihood. Based on this result, we obtain an approximation for the
difference between the Gaussian and Whittle likelihoods in terms of the best
fitting, finite order autoregressive parameters. These approximations are used
to define two new frequency domain quasi-likelihoods criteria. We show that
these new criteria can yield a better approximation of the spectral divergence

and medical investigations of transient associations. However, the most popular
reference-select strategy, the time-stratified schema, is not a suitable
solution for controlling bias in case-crossover studies. To prove this, we
conducted a time series decomposition for daily ozone (O3) records; scrutinized
the ability of the time-stratified schema on controlling the yearly, monthly

trend. Based on this finding, we proposed a new logistic regression approach in
which we did adjustment for the weekly time trend. A comparison between the
traditional model and the proposed method was done by simulation. An empirical
study was conducted to explore potential associations between air pollutants
and AMI hospitalizations. In summary, time-stratified schema provide effective
control on yearly and monthly time trends but not on weekly time trend.
Therefore, the estimation from the traditional logistical regression basically
reveals the effect of weekly time trend, instead of the transient effect. In
contrast, the proposed logistic regression with adjustment for weekly time
trend can effectively eliminate system bias in case-crossover studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06606v1,stat.ME

structure is useful for understanding complex systems. The existing studies
have not fully solved the problem of inferring network structure with partial
or no information about connections or nodes. In this paper, we tackle the
problem by utilizing time series data generated by network dynamics. We regard
the network inference problem based on dynamical time series data as a problem
of minimizing errors for predicting future states and proposed a novel
data-driven deep learning model called Gumbel Graph Network (GGN) to solve the
two kinds of network inference problems: Network Reconstruction and Network
Completion. For the network reconstruction problem, the GGN framework includes
two modules: the dynamics learner and the network generator. For the network
completion problem, GGN adds a new module called the States Learner to infer
missing parts of the network. We carried out experiments on discrete and
continuous time series data. The experiments show that our method can
reconstruct up to 100% network structure on the network reconstruction task.
While the model can also infer the unknown parts of the structure with up to
90% accuracy when some nodes are missing. And the accuracy decays with the

estimate local causal effects of nodes. Furthermore, the relational time-series
causal inference models are able to estimate local effects for individual nodes
by exploiting local node-centric temporal dependencies and
topological/structural dependencies. We show that simpler causal models that do
not consider the graph topology are recovered as special cases of the proposed
relational time-series causal inference model. We describe the conditions under
which the resulting estimate can be used to estimate a causal effect, and
describe how the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test of specification can be used to test
for the consistency of the proposed estimator from data. Empirically, we

empirical observations of human behavior using utility estimation. Our proposed
utility estimation model is a Bayesian network capturing interdependencies

the smoothness properties of the estimator. Through a Monte Carlo study, we
simulate different scenarios of functional processes to show that our estimator

additional noise, random walks, rounding errors and/or drifts are increasingly
used for data analysis in fields such as biology, ecology, engineering and
economics where the length of the observed signals can be extremely large.
Performing inference on and/or prediction from these models can be highly
challenging for several reasons: (i) the data may contain outliers that can
adversely affect the estimation procedure; (ii) the computational complexity
can become prohibitive when models include more than just a few parameters
and/or the time series are large; (iii) model building and/or selection adds
another layer of (computational) complexity to the previous task; and (iv)
solutions that address (i), (ii) and (iii) simultaneously do not exist in

perspective, we first develop the conditions for the joint asymptotic normality
of the latter estimator thereby providing the necessary tools to perform
(direct) inference for scale-based analysis of signals. Taking advantage of the
model-independent weights of this first-step estimator that are computed only
once, we then develop the asymptotic properties of two-step robust estimators

defining the Robust GMWM (RGMWM) that we then use for robust model estimation

exhibit very different statistical behaviors. We prove the consistency of our
estimators under very general conditions and we show that a wide class of trawl
processes satisfy them. This is done in particular by introducing a weighted

transform algorithm is one of state-of-the-art algorithms for classification.
However, its high time complexity is an issue to hinder its application since
its base classifier shapelet transform includes a high time complexity of a
distance calculation and shapelet selection. Therefore, in this paper we
introduce a novel algorithm, i.e. short isometric shapelet transform, which
contains two strategies to reduce the time complexity. The first strategy of
SIST fixes the length of shapelet based on a simplified distance calculation,
which largely reduces the number of shapelet candidates as well as speeds up
the distance calculation in the ensemble shapelet transform algorithm. The
second strategy is to train a single linear classifier in the feature space
instead of an ensemble classifier. The theoretical evidences of these two
strategies are presented to guarantee a near-lossless accuracy under some
preconditions while reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, empirical
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11982v2,cs.LG

often a precursor to further downstream analytics. To date, virtually all works
in the literature have used either shape-based classification using a distance
measure or feature-based classification after finding some suitable features
for the domain. It seems to be underappreciated that in many datasets it is the
case that some classes are best discriminated with features, while others are
best discriminated with shape. Thus, making the shape vs. feature choice will
condemn us to poor results, at least for some classes. In this work, we propose
a new model for classifying time series that allows the use of both shape and
feature-based measures, when warranted. Our algorithm automatically decides
which approach is best for which class, and at query time chooses which
classifier to trust the most. We evaluate our idea on real world datasets and

including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and
other exogenous time series that are only observed historically -- without any
prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep
learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically

Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines
high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into
temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT
utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention
layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized
components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of
gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in
a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate
significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase

delay does not hold in many applications, such as collective behavior,
financial markets, and many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we
develop variable-lag Granger causality, a generalization of Granger causality
that relaxes the assumption of the fixed time delay and allows causes to
influence effects with arbitrary time delays. In addition, we propose a method

hyperparameters for noise filtering. Resulting trading signals as well as
resulting trading signals obtained on the reversed time series are used for

constituents such as turbidity, suspended sediments and nutrients. Analyzing
the concentration (C) of these water quality constituents in response to
increased streamflow discharge (Q), particularly when monitored at high
temporal resolution during a hydrological event, helps to characterize the
dynamics and flux of such constituents. A conventional approach to storm event
analysis is to reduce the C-Q time series to two-dimensional (2-D) hysteresis
loops and analyze these 2-D patterns. While effective and informative to some
extent, this hysteresis loop approach has limitations because projecting the
C-Q time series onto a 2-D plane obscures detail (e.g., temporal variation)

combines the best of traditional statistical models and neural networks. We
focus on time-series with long-range dependencies, needed for monitoring fine
granularity data (e.g. minutes, seconds, milliseconds), prevalent in
operational use-cases.
  Traditional models, such as auto-regression fitted with least squares
(Classic-AR) can model time-series with a concise and interpretable model. When
dealing with long-range dependencies, Classic-AR models can become intractably
slow to fit for large data. Recently, sequence-to-sequence models, such as
Recurrent Neural Networks, which were originally intended for natural language
processing, have become popular for time-series. However, they can be overly
complex for typical time-series data and lack interpretability.
  A scalable and interpretable model is needed to bridge the statistical and
deep learning-based approaches. As a first step towards this goal, we propose
modelling AR-process dynamics using a feed-forward neural network approach,
termed AR-Net. We show that AR-Net is as interpretable as Classic-AR but also
scales to long-range dependencies.
  Our results lead to three major conclusions: First, AR-Net learns identical
AR-coefficients as Classic-AR, thus being equally interpretable. Second, the
computational complexity with respect to the order of the AR process, is linear
for AR-Net as compared to a quadratic for Classic-AR. This makes it possible to
model long-range dependencies within fine granularity data. Third, by
introducing regularization, AR-Net automatically selects and learns sparse
AR-coefficients. This eliminates the need to know the exact order of the
AR-process and allows to learn sparse weights for a model with long-range
dependencies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12436v1,cs.LG

prediction model based on Statistical Recurrent Units (SRUs). We make a case
that the network topology of Granger causal relations is directly inferrable

property or the Temporal Dependency (TD) within financial time-series.
Unfortunately, most previous researches fail to combine these two properties
effectively and often fall short of accuracy and profitability. To effectively
combine and utilize both properties of financial time-series, we propose a
Multi-Scale Temporal Dependent Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network
(MSTD-RCNN) for FTC. In the proposed method, the MS features are simultaneously
extracted by convolutional units to precisely describe the state of the
financial market. Moreover, the TD and complementary across different scales
are captured through a Recurrent Neural Network. The proposed method is
evaluated on three financial time-series datasets which source from the Chinese
stock market. Extensive experimental results indicate that our model achieves
the state-of-the-art performance in trend classification and simulated trading,

variable-length motifs, has received a great amount of attention by researchers
and practitioners. Despite the significant progress that has been made in
recent single dimensional variable-length motif discovery work, detecting
variable-length \textit{subdimensional motifs}---patterns that are
simultaneously occurring only in a subset of dimensions in multivariate time
series---remains a difficult task. The main challenge is scalability. On the
one hand, the brute-force enumeration solution, which searches for motifs of
all possible lengths, is very time consuming even in single dimensional time
series. On the other hand, previous work show that index-based fixed-length
approximate motif discovery algorithms such as random projection are not
suitable for detecting variable-length motifs due to memory requirement. In
this paper, we introduce an approximate variable-length subdimensional motif
discovery algorithm called \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{HI}erarchy based
\textbf{M}otif \textbf{E}numeration (CHIME) to efficiently detect
variable-length subdimensional motifs given a minimum motif length in
large-scale multivariate time series. We show that the memory cost of the
approach is significantly smaller than that of random projection. Moreover, the
speed of the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than that of the
state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that CHIME can efficiently detect
meaningful variable-length subdimensional motifs in large real world
multivariate time series datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09218v1,cs.LG

class of dynamic models -- random walk dynamic linear models -- produce exact
minimax predictive densities. We first show this result under Gaussian
assumptions, then relax this assumption using semi-martingale processes. This
result provides a theoretical baseline, under both non-stationary and
stationary time series data, for which other models can be compared against. We
extend the result to the synthesis of multiple predictive densities. Three

Most KG embedding models learn from time-unaware triples. However, the
inclusion of temporal information beside triples would further improve the
performance of a KGE model. In this regard, we propose ATiSE, a temporal KG
embedding model which incorporates time information into entity/relation
representations by using Additive Time Series decomposition. Moreover,
considering the temporal uncertainty during the evolution of entity/relation
representations over time, we map the representations of temporal KGs into the
space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The mean of each
entity/relation embedding at a time step shows the current expected position,
whereas its covariance (which is temporally stationary) represents its temporal
uncertainty. Experimental results show that ATiSE chieves the state-of-the-art

be used as an alternative to real medical data, which has privacy costs and
resource constraints associated with it. At present, most models focus on
generating cross-sectional health data which is not necessarily representative

patient having multiple health events, non-uniformly distributed throughout
their lifetime. These events are influenced by patient covariates such as
comorbidities, age group, gender etc. as well as external temporal effects
(e.g. flu season). While there exist seminal methods to model time series data,
it becomes increasingly challenging to extend these methods to medical event
time series data. Due to the complexity of the real data, in which each patient
visit is an event, we transform the data by using summary statistics to
characterize the events for a fixed set of time intervals, to facilitate
analysis and interpretability. We then train a generative adversarial network
to generate synthetic data. We demonstrate this approach by generating human
sleep patterns, from a publicly available dataset. We empirically evaluate the

high-dimensional nonstationary time series. Two types of dynamic behaviors are
considered: structural breaks (i.e., abrupt change points) and smooth changes.
To simultaneously handle these two types of time-varying features, a two-step
approach is proposed: multiple change point locations are first identified
based on comparing the difference between the localized averages on sample
covariance matrices, and then graph supports are recovered based on a
kernelized time-varying constrained $L_1$-minimization for inverse matrix
estimation (CLIME) estimator on each segment. We derive the rates of
convergence for estimating the change points and precision matrices under mild
moment and dependence conditions. In particular, we show that this two-step

orthogonal transformations and the calculation of posterior probabilities based
on a continuous-density hidden Markov model with a Gaussian mixture model
expressed in the reduced-dimensional space. The analysis can be incorporated
into a neural network, which is named a time-series discriminant component
network (TSDCN), so that parameters of dimensionality reduction and
classification can be obtained simultaneously as network coefficients according
to a backpropagation through time-based learning algorithm with the Lagrange
multiplier method. The TSDCN is considered to enable high-accuracy

Secondly, we show that CL based on a sliding window learner (FFNN) is more

changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a
Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual.
This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the
difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as

ubiquitous in many real-world applications such as monitoring urban traffic and
air quality. Making predictions on these time series has become a critical
challenge due to not only the large-scale and high-dimensional nature but also
the considerable amount of missing data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
temporal factorization (BTF) framework for modeling multidimensional time
series -- in particular spatiotemporal data -- in the presence of missing
values. By integrating low-rank matrix/tensor factorization and vector
autoregressive (VAR) process into a single probabilistic graphical model, this
framework can characterize both global and local consistencies in large-scale
time series data. The graphical model allows us to effectively perform
probabilistic predictions and produce uncertainty estimates without imputing
those missing values. We develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for model
inference and model updating for real-time prediction and test the proposed BTF
framework on several real-world spatiotemporal data sets for both missing data
imputation and multi-step rolling prediction tasks. The numerical experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BTF approaches over existing

commonly used to capture the behavior of various equipment and varying
environmental characteristics. Despite the advantages of these data-driven
models on excellent adaptivity to high dynamics and aging equipment, they are
usually hungry to massive labels over historical data, mostly contributed by
human engineers at an extremely high cost. The label demand is now the major
limiting factor to modeling accuracy, hindering the fulfillment of visions for
applications. Fortunately, domain adaptation enhances the model generalization
by utilizing the labelled source data as well as the unlabelled target data and
then we can reuse the model on different domains. However, the mainstream
domain adaptation methods cannot achieve ideal performance on time series data,
because most of them focus on static samples and even the existing time series
domain adaptation methods ignore the properties of time series data, such as
temporal causal mechanism. In this paper, we assume that causal mechanism is
invariant and present our Causal Mechanism Transfer Network(CMTN) for time
series domain adaptation. By capturing and transferring the dynamic and
temporal causal mechanism of multivariate time series data and alleviating the
time lags and different value ranges among different machines, CMTN allows the
data-driven models to exploit existing data and labels from similar systems,

computational complexity in both signal length and ambient dimension. This
representation, which we call Laplacian Events Signal Segmentation (LESS), can
be computed on time series of arbitrary dimension and originating from sensors
of arbitrary type. Hence, time series originating from sensors of heterogeneous
type can be compressed to levels demanded by constrained-communication
environments, before being fused at a common center.
  Temporal dynamics of the data is summarized without explicit partitioning or
probabilistic modeling. As a proof-of-principle, we apply this technique on
high dimensional wavelet coefficients computed from the Free Spoken Digit
Dataset to generate a memory efficient representation that is interpretable.

two classes of such mechanisms -- variations in sampling rate relative to the

factorization of a data matrix into a dictionary and time-varying coefficients
with potentially nonlinear Markovian dependencies. The assumed Markovian
structure on the coefficients enables us to encode temporal dependencies into a
low-dimensional feature space. The proposed inference method is solely based on
an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme, which makes the resulting
method particularly efficient. PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities
and, more importantly, can be used to calibrate and estimate generic
differentiable nonlinear subspace models. We also introduce a robust version of
PSMF, called rPSMF, which uses Student-t filters to handle model
misspecification. We show that PSMF can be used in multiple contexts: modeling

generalization of the notion of KL divergence often used to compare probability
distributions to a notion of divergence in time series. We call this the
sequence likelihood (SL) divergence, which may be used to measure deviations

the best algorithm. In recent years, a recommender system scheme has been
developed for time series analysis using a meta-learning approach. This system
selects the best forecasting method with consideration of the time series
characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to focusing on some
of the unanswered questions resulting from the use of meta-learning in time
series forecasting. Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed
including, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for
meta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and
assessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the
forecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with
the help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners.
For this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the
NN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six
machine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the
extracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable
forecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters.
Furthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to
investigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of
meta-learners. In general, it was found that meta-learners were able to defeat
all of the individual benchmark forecasters; this performance was improved even
after applying the feature selection method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08489v1,stat.ML

nonstationary time series. The approach is Bayesian and uses a
covariate-dependent infinite mixture model to incorporate multiple time series,
with mixture components parameterized by a time varying mean and log spectrum.
The mixture components are based on AdaptSPEC, a nonparametric model which
adaptively divides the time series into an unknown number of segments and
estimates the local log spectra by smoothing splines. We extend AdaptSPEC to
handle missing values, a common feature of time series which can cause
difficulties for nonparametric spectral methods. A second extension is to allow
for a time varying mean. Covariates, assumed to be time-independent, are
incorporated via the mixture weights using the logistic stick breaking process.
The model can estimate time varying means and spectra at observed and
unobserved covariate values, allowing for predictive inference. Estimation is
performed by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, combining data

non-trivial, as the permutation test is invalid. This work juxtaposes distance

propose a mixed hierarchical seasonality (MHS) model. Intermediate parameters

relative importance of each seasonality and addresses the interactions between
them. The model is implemented with Stan, a probabilistic language, and was

attributes weights to features to explain an observations risk of belonging to
a class as a multiplicative factor of a base hazard rate. We use a variation of

in the time series is a noisy linear combination of some previous observations
along with a constant shift. To tackle the problem of prediction with missing
values, a number of methods were proposed based on various data models. For
real application scenarios, how do these methods perform over different types
of time series with different levels of data missing remains to be
investigated. In this paper, we focus on online methods for AR-model-based time
series prediction with missing values. We adapted five mainstream methods to
fit in such a scenario. We make detailed discussion on each of them by
introducing their core ideas about how to estimate the AR coefficients and
their different strategies to deal with missing values. We also present
algorithmic implementations for better understanding. In order to
comprehensively evaluate these methods and do the comparison, we conduct
experiments with various configurations of relative parameters over both

series after as few measurements as possible with the highest possible
accuracy. The most critical issue of any eTSC method is to decide when enough
data of a time series has been seen to take a decision: Waiting for more data
points usually makes the classification problem easier but delays the time in
which a classification is made; in contrast, earlier classification has to cope
with less input data, often leading to inferior accuracy. The state-of-the-art
eTSC methods compute a fixed optimal decision time assuming that every times
series has the same defined start time (like turning on a machine). However, in
many real-life applications measurements start at arbitrary times (like
measuring heartbeats of a patient), implying that the best time for taking a
decision varies heavily between time series. We present TEASER, a novel
algorithm that models eTSC as a two two-tier classification problem: In the
first tier, a classifier periodically assesses the incoming time series to
compute class probabilities. However, these class probabilities are only used
as output label if a second-tier classifier decides that the predicted label is
reliable enough, which can happen after a different number of measurements. In
an evaluation using 45 benchmark datasets, TEASER is two to three times earlier
at predictions than its competitors while reaching the same or an even higher
classification accuracy. We further show TEASER's superior performance using
real-life use cases, namely energy monitoring, and gait detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03405v2,cs.LG

time series, after deterministically subtracting geophysical signals from the
observations. This residual time series is then assumed to be a sum of three
random variables (r.v.), with the last r.v. belonging to the family of Levy
processes. This stochastic term models the remaining residual signals and other
correlated processes. Via simulations and real time series, we identify three
classes of Levy processes: Gaussian, fractional and stable. In the first case,
residuals are predominantly constituted of short-memory processes. Fractional
Levy process can be an alternative model to the fBm in the presence of
long-term correlations and self-similarity property. Stable process is
characterized by a large variance, which can be satisfied in the case of
heavy-tailed distributions. The application to geodetic time series imply

Topological Data Analysis. Clustering data from five waves of the National
Household Travel Survey ranging from 1990 to 2017 suggests that activity-travel
patterns of individuals over the last three decades can be grouped into three
clusters. Results also provide evidence in support of recent claims about
differences in activity-travel patterns of different survey cohorts. The
proposed method is generally applicable and is not limited only to
activity-travel behavior analysis in transportation studies. Driving behavior,

interpretability. We propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for
dimensionality reduction and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple
and interpretable: the high dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional
representation which evolves smoothly in time according to a Gaussian process.
The non-linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of missing data is
achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured variational
approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several classical

for principal component analysis. In particular, the problems of frequency
estimation, forecasting and missing values imputation can be solved within the
framework of SSA. The idea of SSA came from different scientific communities,
such as that of researchers in time series analysis (Karhunen-Loeve

estimation) and multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis).
Also, depending on the area of applications, different viewpoints on the same

the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture
is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in
time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer
grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long

convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal
convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention

HIVE-COTE recognizes that time series data are a specific data type for which
the traditional attribute-value representation, used predominantly in machine
learning, fails to provide a relevant representation. HIVE-COTE combines
multiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific
aspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or
summarization of intervals within the series. However, HIVE-COTE (and its
predecessor, FLAT-COTE) is often infeasible to run on even modest amounts of
data. For instance, training HIVE-COTE on a dataset with only 1,500 time series
can require 8 days of CPU time. It has polynomial runtime with respect to the
training set size, so this problem compounds as data quantity increases. We
propose a novel TSC algorithm, TS-CHIEF (Time Series Combination of
Heterogeneous and Integrated Embedding Forest), which rivals HIVE-COTE in
accuracy but requires only a fraction of the runtime. TS-CHIEF constructs an
ensemble classifier that integrates the most effective embeddings of time
series that research has developed in the last decade. It uses tree-structured
classifiers to do so efficiently. We assess TS-CHIEF on 85 datasets of the

series data. On the other hand, time series data, due to its nature, often
exhibits localized expansions and compressions in the time dimension which is
called warping. These two challenges make it hard to detect anomalies in time
series as often such warpings could get detected as anomalies erroneously. Our
objective is to build an anomaly detection model that is robust to such warping
variations. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised time series anomaly
detection method, WaRTEm-AD, that operates in two stages. Within the key stage
of representation learning, we employ data augmentation through bespoke time
series operators which are passed through a twin autoencoder architecture to
learn warping-robust representations for time series data. Second, adaptations
of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods are employed on the learnt

and even endanger their lives. In order to reduce air pollution concentrations,

urgent to design an accurate and reliable air pollutant forecasting model.
However, most previous research have many deficiencies, such as ignoring the
importance of predictive stability, and poor initial parameters and so on,
which have significantly effect on the performance of air pollution prediction.
Therefore, to address these issues, a novel hybrid model is proposed in this
study. Specifically, a powerful data preprocessing techniques is applied to
decompose the original time series into different modes from low- frequency to
high- frequency. Next, a new multi-objective algorithm called MOHHO is first
developed in this study, which are introduced to tune the parameters of ELM
model with high forecasting accuracy and stability for air pollution series
prediction, simultaneously. And the optimized ELM model is used to perform the
time series prediction. Finally, a scientific and robust evaluation system
including several error criteria, benchmark models, and several experiments
using six air pollutant concentrations time series from three cities in China
is designed to perform a compressive assessment for the presented hybrid
forecasting model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model

Models (MDMMs), allowing us to filter and smooth in the presence of missing

method by factorizing the posterior p(z|x) for non-linear state space models,
and develop a variational backward-forward algorithm for inference. Because our
method handles incompleteness over both time and modalities, it is capable of
interpolation, extrapolation, conditional generation, label prediction, and
weakly supervised learning of multimodal time series. We demonstrate these
capabilities on both synthetic and real-world multimodal data under high levels
of data deletion. Our method performs well even with more than 50% missing

driven by scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly
cross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model and theory are developed in
a general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional and

the mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each
segment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design
multi-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into
symbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX
distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has
a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX.
The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our
proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX
representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00421v1,cs.LG

(CTN): an off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on
diverse univariate time series classification (TSC) source tasks. Once trained,
CTN can be easily adapted to new TSC target tasks via a small amount of
fine-tuning using labeled instances from the target tasks. We note that the
length of convolutional filters is a key aspect when building a pre-trained
model that can generalize to time series of different lengths across datasets.
To achieve this, we incorporate filters of multiple lengths in all
convolutional layers of CTN to capture temporal features at multiple time
scales. We consider all 65 datasets with time series of lengths up to 512
points from the UCR TSC Benchmark for training and testing transferability of
CTN: We train CTN on a randomly chosen subset of 24 datasets using a multi-head
approach with a different softmax layer for each training dataset, and study
generalizability and transferability of the learned filters on the remaining 41
TSC datasets. We observe significant gains in classification accuracy as well
as computational efficiency when using pre-trained CTN as a starting point for
subsequent task-specific fine-tuning compared to existing state-of-the-art TSC
approaches. We also provide qualitative insights into the working of CTN by: i)
analyzing the activations and filters of first convolution layer suggesting the
filters in CTN are generically useful, ii) analyzing the impact of the design
decision to incorporate multiple length decisions, and iii) finding regions of
time series that affect the final classification decision via occlusion
sensitivity analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12546v2,cs.LG

difference-in-differences), the change in outcome in a group exposed to
treatment in the periods before and after the exposure is compared to the
change in outcome in a control group not exposed to treatment in either period.
The standard difference-in-difference estimator for a comparative interrupted
time series design will be biased for estimating the causal effect of the
treatment if there is an interaction between history in the after period and
the groups; for example, there is a historical event besides the start of the
treatment in the after period that benefits the treated group more than the
control group. We present a bracketing method for bounding the effect of an
interaction between history and the groups that arises from a time-invariant
unmeasured confounder having a different effect in the after period than the
before period. The method is applied to a study of the effect of the repeal of
Missouri's permit-to-purchase handgun law on its firearm homicide rate. We
estimate that the effect of the permit-to-purchase repeal on Missouri's firearm

independent, additive mixtures of latent time series. We show that when the
latent time series are uncorrelated at a lag of one time-step then, in the
large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a
column-wise normalization, the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus, DMD is a
time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise, but is different
from closely related second order algorithms such as the Second-Order Blind
Identification (SOBI) method and the Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals

to know whether m is constant or whether it is increasing/decreasing in certain

Distance covariance can discriminate between dependence and independence of two

to inform predictions for future observations. In the absence of any actual new
data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model's future

selection. Exact cross-validation for Bayesian models is often computationally
expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most
notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual
prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an
overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is
available to influence predictions of the past. To properly account for the
time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV).
Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires refitting the model many times to

to long time series. The challenge is two-fold: not only do computations scale
linearly with time, as in the linear case, but particle filters additionally
suffer from increasing particle degeneracy with longer series. Stochastic
gradient MCMC methods have been developed to scale Bayesian inference for
finite-state hidden Markov models and linear SSMs using buffered stochastic
gradient estimates to account for temporal dependencies. We extend these
stochastic gradient estimators to nonlinear SSMs using particle methods. We
present error bounds that account for both buffering error and particle error
in the case of nonlinear SSMs that are log-concave in the latent process. We
evaluate our proposed particle buffered stochastic gradient using stochastic
gradient MCMC for inference on both long sequential synthetic and
minute-resolution financial returns data, demonstrating the importance of this
class of methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10568v3,stat.ML

numerous practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and speech
recognition. A popular and effective approach is to classify new time series in
the same way as their nearest neighbours, whereby proximity is defined using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, a measure analogous to sequence alignment
in bioinformatics. However, practitioners are not only interested in accurate
classification, they are also interested in why a time series is classified a
certain way. To this end, we introduce here the problem of finding a minimum
length subsequence of a time series, the removal of which changes the outcome
of the classification under the nearest neighbour algorithm with DTW distance.
Informally, such a subsequence is expected to be relevant for the
classification and can be helpful for practitioners in interpreting the
outcome. We describe a simple but optimized implementation for detecting these
subsequences and define an accompanying measure to quantify the relevance of
every time point in the time series for the classification. In tests on
electrocardiogram data we show that the algorithm allows discovery of important
subsequences and can be helpful in detecting abnormalities in cardiac rhythms

It is based on directly bootstrapping the time series of tensor products which
overcomes some common difficulties associated with applications of the

in these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be
carefully addressed for each of them. In this work, a novel Temporal Logistic
Neural Bag-of-Features approach, that can be used to tackle these challenges,
is proposed. The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural

However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose
significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not
stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially
difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause
significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is
capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling
mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation
involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a

dynamic functional principal components and their associated scores.
Conditioning on the estimated functional principal components, the crux of the

business. The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate
methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of

series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial.
Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large
numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be
correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a

observations, where it is assumed that a hidden state process selects which of
finitely many distributions generates any given observation. Specifically for
time series of counts, the Poisson family often provides a natural choice for
the state-dependent distributions, though more flexible distributions such as
the negative binomial or distributions with a bounded range can also be used.
However, in practice, choosing an adequate class of (parametric) distributions
is often anything but straightforward, and an inadequate choice can have severe
negative consequences on the model's predictive performance, on state
classification, and generally on inference related to the system considered. To
address this issue, we propose an effectively nonparametric approach to fitting
hidden Markov models to time series of counts, where the state-dependent
distributions are estimated in a completely data-driven way without the need to
select a distributional family. To avoid overfitting, we add a roughness
penalty based on higher-order differences between adjacent count probabilities
to the likelihood, which is demonstrated to produce smooth probability mass
functions of the state-dependent distributions. The feasibility of the

certain period of time. The treatment effect evolves during this period which
provides crucial insights into the treatment response and the long-term
effects. Many conventional methods for estimating treatment effects are limited
to the i.i.d. setting and are not suited for inferring the time dynamics of the
treatment effect. The time series encountered in these settings are highly
informative but often nonstationary due to the changing effects of treatment.
This increases the difficulty, since stationarity, a common assumption in time
series analysis, cannot be reasonably assumed. Another challenge is the
heterogeneity of the treatment effect when the treatment affects units
differently. The task of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from
nonstationary and, in particular, interventional time series is highly relevant
but has remained unexplored yet. We propose Causal Transfer, a method which
combines regression to adjust for confounding with time series modelling to
learn the effect of the treatment and how it evolves over time. Causal Transfer
does not assume the data to be stationary and can be applied to randomized
trials and observational studies in which treatment is confounded. Causal
Transfer adjusts the effect for possible confounders and transfers the learned
effect to other time series and, thereby, estimates various forms of treatment
effects, such as the average treatment effect (ATE) or the conditional average

influence between $M$ actors given multi-variate time series data for $T$ time

particular, prior work on hypothesis testing in time series has been restricted
to linear Gaussian auto-regressive models. From a practical perspective, it is
important to determine suitable statistical tests for connections between
actors that go beyond the Gaussian assumption. In the context of
\emph{high-dimensional} time series models, confidence intervals present
additional estimators since most estimators such as the Lasso and Dantzig

challenge lies in the fact that unlike Gaussian random vectors, for
sub-Gaussian vectors zero correlation does not imply independence. The proof

such as commercial cloud management, manufacturing predictive maintenance, and
portfolios performance analysis, such dependencies can be non-linear and
time-variant, which makes it more challenging to extract such dependencies
through traditional methods such as Granger causality or clustering. In this
work, we present a novel deep learning model that uses multiple layers of
customized gated recurrent units (GRUs) for discovering both time lagged
behaviors as well as inter-timeseries dependencies in the form of directed
weighted graphs. We introduce a key component of Dual-purpose recurrent neural
network that decodes information in the temporal domain to discover lagged
dependencies within each time series, and encodes them into a set of vectors
which, collected from all component time series, form the informative inputs to
discover inter-dependencies. Though the discovery of two types of dependencies
are separated at different hierarchical levels, they are tightly connected and
jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. With this joint training, learning of
one type of dependency immediately impacts the learning of the other one,
leading to overall accurate dependencies discovery. We empirically test our
model on synthetic time series data in which the exact form of (non-linear)
dependencies is known. We also evaluate its performance on two real-world
applications, (i) performance monitoring data from a commercial cloud provider,

timestamps, a time-discounting convolution. Unlike in ordinary time series,
time intervals are not constant, small time-shifts have no significant effect,
and inputting timestamps or time durations into a model is not effective. The
criteria that we require for the modeling are providing robustness against
time-shifts or timestamps uncertainty as well as maintaining the essential
capabilities of time-series models, i.e., forgetting meaningless past
information and handling infinite sequences. The proposed method handles them
with a convolutional mechanism across time with specific parameterizations,
which efficiently represents the event dependencies in a time-shift invariant
manner while discounting the effect of past events, and a dynamic pooling
mechanism, which provides robustness against the uncertainty in timestamps and
enhances the time-discounting capability by dynamically changing the pooling
window size. In our learning algorithm, the decaying and dynamic pooling
mechanisms play critical roles in handling infinite and variable length
sequences. Numerical experiments on real-world event sequences with ambiguous
timestamps and ordinary time series demonstrated the advantages of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02395v1,cs.LG

problem in time series and signal processing. In modern neuroscience, spectral
density based metrics are commonly used for analyzing functional connectivity

regularized estimation of high-dimensional spectral density matrices of
Gaussian and linear processes using thresholded versions of averaged
periodograms. Our theoretical analysis ensures that consistent estimation of
spectral density matrix of a $p$-dimensional time series using $n$ samples is
possible under high-dimensional regime $\log p / n \rightarrow 0$ as long as
the true spectral density is approximately sparse. A key technical component of
our analysis is a new concentration inequality of average periodogram around
its expectation, which is of independent interest. Our estimation consistency
results complement existing results for shrinkage based estimators of
multivariate spectral density, which require no assumption on sparsity but only
ensure consistent estimation in a regime $p^2/n \rightarrow 0$. In addition,
our proposed thresholding based estimators perform consistent and automatic
edge selection when learning coherence networks among the components of a

finding its limiting distribution under general conditions, and the asymptotic

positive definiteness. However, asymptotic properties such as posterior

Our approach is based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN),

discriminative step by a convolutional NN. Both the generator and the
discriminator are conditioned on the sampling timestamps, to learn the hidden
relationship between data and timestamps, and consequently to generate new time

real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly
detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying
abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building
such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture
the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the
inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the
system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of
anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact
that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed,
few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a
Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform
anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically,
MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to
characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps.
Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed
to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based
Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture
the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the
inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is
used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature

methodology, has traditionally been carried out under the assumption of
complete observation of the constituent series of curves, assumed stationary.
Nevertheless, as is often the case with independent functional data, it may
well happen that the data available to the analyst are not the actual sequence
of curves, but relatively few and noisy measurements per curve, potentially at
different locations in each curve's domain. Under this sparse sampling regime,
neither the established estimators of the time series' dynamics, nor their
corresponding theoretical analysis will apply. The subject of this paper is to
tackle the problem of estimating the dynamics and of recovering the latent
process of smooth curves in the sparse regime. Assuming smoothness of the
latent curves, we construct a consistent nonparametric estimator of the series'
spectral density operator and use it develop a frequency-domain recovery
approach, that predicts the latent curve at a given time by borrowing strength
from the (estimated) dynamic correlations in the series across time. Further to
predicting the latent curves from their noisy point samples, the method fills
in gaps in the sequence (curves nowhere sampled), denoises the data, and serves
as a basis for forecasting. Means of providing corresponding confidence bands
are also investigated. A simulation study interestingly suggests that sparse
observation for a longer time period, may be provide better performance than
dense observation for a shorter period, in the presence of smoothness. The
methodology is further illustrated by application to an environmental data set

their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a
specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method.
However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different
subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better
compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a
novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a
first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to
each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns
different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same
dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the
segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical
clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of
segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time
series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping
process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects
are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust
the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the
segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series
Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods,
showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11624v1,cs.LG

their spectral density matrix as the frequency domain analog of the covariance

first non-asymptotic result for characterising the difference between the

justify a range of high-dimensional models for analysing time series. As a
concrete example, we apply this result to establish the convergence of the

scalable Bayesian inference for large independent data. Unfortunately when
applied to dependent data, such as in SSMs, SGMCMC's stochastic gradient
estimates are biased as they break crucial temporal dependencies. To alleviate
this, we propose stochastic gradient estimators that control this bias by
performing additional computation in a `buffer' to reduce breaking
dependencies. Furthermore, we derive error bounds for this bias and show a
geometric decay under mild conditions. Using these estimators, we develop novel
SGMCMC samplers for discrete, continuous and mixed-type SSMs with analytic
message passing. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the

fairly general conditions, the asymptotic properties of the corresponding

a Periodicity-based Parallel Time Series Prediction (PPTSP) algorithm for
large-scale time-series data is proposed and implemented in the Apache Spark
cloud computing environment. To effectively handle the massive historical
datasets, a Time Series Data Compression and Abstraction (TSDCA) algorithm is
presented, which can reduce the data scale as well as accurately extracting the

multivariate time series data consisting of a large number of system
measurements over a period of time. Such data can be interpreted as a sequence
of states, where each state represents a prototype of system behavior. An
important problem in this domain is to identify repeated sequences of states,
known as motifs. Such motifs correspond to complex behaviors that capture
common sequences of state transitions. For example, in automotive data, a motif
of ""making a turn"" might manifest as a sequence of states: slowing down,
turning the wheel, and then speeding back up. However, discovering these motifs
is challenging, because the individual states and state assignments are
unknown, have different durations, and need to be jointly learned from the
noisy time series. Here we develop motif-aware state assignment (MASA), a
method to discover common motifs in noisy time series data and leverage those
motifs to more robustly assign states to measurements. We formulate the problem
of motif discovery as a large optimization problem, which we solve using an
expectation-maximization type approach. MASA performs well in the presence of
noise in the input data and is scalable to very large datasets. Experiments on

the last decade. The UCR time series archive has played a significant role in
challenging and guiding the development of new learners for time series
classification. The largest dataset in the UCR archive holds 10 thousand time
series only; which may explain why the primary research focus has been in
creating algorithms that have high accuracy on relatively small datasets.
  This paper introduces Proximity Forest, an algorithm that learns accurate
models from datasets with millions of time series, and classifies a time series
in milliseconds. The models are ensembles of highly randomized Proximity Trees.
Whereas conventional decision trees branch on attribute values (and usually
perform poorly on time series), Proximity Trees branch on the proximity of time
series to one exemplar time series or another; allowing us to leverage the
decades of work into developing relevant measures for time series. Proximity
Forest gains both efficiency and accuracy by stochastic selection of both
exemplars and similarity measures.
  Our work is motivated by recent time series applications that provide orders
of magnitude more time series than the UCR benchmarks. Our experiments
demonstrate that Proximity Forest is highly competitive on the UCR archive: it
ranks among the most accurate classifiers while being significantly faster. We
demonstrate on a 1M time series Earth observation dataset that Proximity Forest
retains this accuracy on datasets that are many orders of magnitude greater
than those in the UCR repository, while learning its models at least 100,000
times faster than current state of the art models Elastic Ensemble and COTE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10594v2,cs.LG

other over time. Meanwhile, as part of the continued digitization of industrial
processes, various sensor technologies are deployed that enable us to record
time-varying attributes (a.k.a., time series) of such entities, thus producing
correlated time series. To enable accurate forecasting on such correlated time
series, this paper proposes two models that combine convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The first model employs a
CNN on each individual time series, combines the convoluted features, and then
applies an RNN on top of the convoluted features in the end to enable
forecasting. The second model adds additional auto-encoders into the individual
CNNs, making the second model a multi-task learning model, which provides
accurate and robust forecasting. Experiments on two real-world correlated time
series data set suggest that the proposed two models are effective and
outperform baselines in most settings.

for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between time series. These have many
applications in time series indexing, clustering, forecasting, regression and
classification. One of the key time series classification algorithms, the
nearest neighbor algorithm with DTW distance (NN-DTW) is very expensive to
compute, due to the quadratic complexity of DTW. Lower bound search can speed
up NN-DTW substantially. An effective and tight lower bound quickly prunes off
unpromising nearest neighbor candidates from the search space and minimises the
number of the costly DTW computations. The speed up provided by lower bound
search becomes increasingly critical as training set size increases. Different
lower bounds provide different trade-offs between computation time and
tightness. Most existing lower bounds interact with DTW warping window sizes.
They are very tight and effective at smaller warping window sizes, but become
looser as the warping window increases, thus reducing the pruning effectiveness
for NN-DTW. In this work, we present a new class of lower bounds that are
tighter than the popular Keogh lower bound, while requiring similar computation
time. Our new lower bounds take advantage of the DTW boundary condition,
monotonicity and continuity constraints to create a tighter lower bound. Of
particular significance, they remain relatively tight even for large windows. A
single parameter to these new lower bounds controls the speed-tightness
trade-off. We demonstrate that these new lower bounds provide an exceptional
balance between computation time and tightness for the NN-DTW time series
classification task, resulting in greatly improved efficiency for NN-DTW lower
bound search.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09617v3,cs.LG

However, for the non independent case, almost all the results concern
stationary time series. This excludes many important applications: for example
any series with a periodic behavior is non-stationary. In this paper, we extend
the basic tools of Dedecker and Fan (2015) to nonstationary Markov chains. As

by treating a $p$-dimensional time series as a nonsingular linear
transformation of certain common factors and idiosyncratic components. Unlike
the approximate factor models, we assume that the factors capture all the
non-trivial dynamics of the data, but the cross-sectional dependence may be
explained by both the factors and the idiosyncratic components. Under the
proposed model, (a) the factor process is dynamically dependent and the
idiosyncratic component is a white noise process, and (b) the largest
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic components may
diverge to infinity as the dimension $p$ increases. We propose a white noise
testing procedure for high-dimensional time series to determine the number of
white noise components and, hence, the number of common factors, and introduce
a projected Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to eliminate the diverging
effect of the idiosyncratic noises. Asymptotic properties of the proposed
method are established for both fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ as the sample size
$n$ increases to infinity. We use both simulated data and real examples to
assess the performance of the proposed method. We also compare our method with
two commonly used methods in the literature concerning the forecastability of
the extracted factors and find that the proposed approach not only provides
interpretable results, but also performs well in out-of-sample forecasting.

(CNNs) with one-dimensional convolutions to clinical tasks involving
time-series data. This is due, in part, to their computational efficiency,
relative to recurrent neural networks and their ability to efficiently exploit
certain temporal invariances, (e.g., phase invariance). However, it is
well-established that clinical data may exhibit many other types of invariances
(e.g., scaling). While preprocessing techniques, (e.g., dynamic time warping)
may successfully transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to
identify the types of invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use
of Sequence Transformer Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that
learns to identify and account for invariances in clinical time-series data.
Applied to the task of predicting in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach
achieves an improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic

high-dimensional time series and space-time data by decomposing individual
series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components. For ease in analyzing
many time series, we employ a time polynomial for the trend, a linear
combination of trigonometric series for the seasonal component, and a new
factor model for the irregular components. The new factor model can simplify
the modeling process and achieve parsimony in parameterization. We propose a
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to consistently determine the order of the
polynomial trend and the number of trigonometric functions. A test statistic is
used to determine the number of common factors. The convergence rates for the
estimators of the trend and seasonal components and the limiting distribution
of the test statistic are established under the setting that the number of time
series tends to infinity with the sample size, but at a slower rate. We use
simulation to study the performance of the proposed analysis in finite samples

different format, it often contains contextual explanations for many of the

decade, with many new classification approaches published each year. The
research focus has mostly been on improving the accuracy and efficiency of
classifiers, while their interpretability has been somewhat neglected.
Classifier interpretability has become a critical constraint for many
application domains and the introduction of the 'right to explanation' GDPR EU
legislation in May 2018 is likely to further emphasize the importance of
explainable learning algorithms. In this work we analyse the state-of-the-art
for time series classification, and propose new algorithms that aim to maintain
the classifier accuracy and efficiency, but keep interpretability as a key
design constraint. We present new time series classification algorithms that
advance the state-of-the-art by implementing the following three key ideas: (1)
Multiple resolutions of symbolic approximations: we combine symbolic
representations obtained using different parameters; (2) Multiple domain
representations: we combine symbolic approximations in time (e.g., SAX) and
frequency (e.g., SFA) domains; (3) Efficient navigation of a huge
symbolic-words space: we adapt a symbolic sequence classifier named SEQL, to
make it work with multiple domain representations (e.g., SAX-SEQL, SFA-SEQL),
and use its greedy feature selection strategy to effectively filter the best
features for each representation. We show that a multi-resolution multi-domain
linear classifier, SAX-SFA-SEQL, achieves a similar accuracy to the
state-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to a recent deep learning method (FCN), but
uses a fraction of the time required by either COTE or FCN. We discuss the

further analyse the interpretability aspect of our classifiers, we present a

models, model parameters are estimated based on trajectories of fully recorded

algorithm for time series with missing data was introduced and proved to be

changepoints, is important for many applications. However, many procedures rely
on the estimation of nuisance parameters (like long-run variance). Under the
alternative (a change in mean), estimators might be biased and data-adaptive
rules for the choice of tuning parameters might not work as expected. If the
data is not stationary, but heteroscedastic, this becomes more challenging. The
aim of this paper is to present and investigate two changepoint tests, which
involve neither nuisance nor tuning parameters. This is achieved by combing
self-normalization and wild bootstrap. We study the asymptotic behavior and
show the consistency of the bootstrap under the hypothesis as well as under the
alternative, assuming mild conditions on the weak dependence of the time series
and allowing the variance to change over time. As a by-product of the proposed
tests, a changepoint estimator is introduced and its consistency is proved. The

computational efficiency of the developed methods. The new tests will also be

Our study illustrates several key concepts crucial to analyzing time-series

these ideas extend to R > 1 local periodic components, using the linearity
property of the Fourier transform. Next, we propose a simple procedure for
estimating the 5 parameters of our local periodic signal model using the SWDFT.
Our estimation procedure speeds up computation by using a trigonometric

There

prediction. In this paper, a new kind of feature that can describe the process
of temporal and spatial variation is proposed, namely, Spatio-Temporal
Features. We first map the data collected at each moment from the wind turbine
to the plane to form the state map, namely, the scene, according to the
relative positions. The scene time series over a period of time is a
multi-channel image, i.e. the Spatio-Temporal Features. Based on the

this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called
multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware
deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of
multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables
the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based
on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual

2018-06-12 13:40:30+00:00,A review on distance based time series classification,"['Amaia Abanda', 'Usue Mori', 'Jose A. Lozano']","Time series classification is an increasing research topic due to the vast
amount of time series data that are being created over a wide variety of
fields. The particularity of the data makes it a challenging task and different
approaches have been taken, including the distance based approach. 1-NN has
been a widely used method within distance based time series classification due
to it simplicity but still good performance. However, its supremacy may be
attributed to being able to use specific distances for time series within the
classification process and not to the classifier itself. With the aim of
exploiting these distances within more complex classifiers, new approaches have
arisen in the past few years that are competitive or which outperform the 1-NN
based approaches. In some cases, these new methods use the distance measure to
transform the series into feature vectors, bridging the gap between time series
and traditional classifiers. In other cases, the distances are employed to
obtain a time series kernel and enable the use of kernel methods for time
series classification. One of the main challenges is that a kernel function
must be positive semi-definite, a matter that is also addressed within this
review. The presented review includes a taxonomy of all those methods that aim
to classify time series using a distance based approach, as well as a
discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04509v1,stat.ML

cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas
could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most
representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to
interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient
properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time. To address this
problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas
from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative
modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time
series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior
clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the
non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a
gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is
more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic
interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation
space. This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves
clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory
insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty. We evaluate our
model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static
(Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST
images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on
a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set.

patient-specific component that models idiosyncratic variability for each
patient. To this end, we propose a composite model of a deep neural network to
learn complex global trends from the large number of patients, and Gaussian

in which a time series of functional data is regressed on a time series of
scalar predictors. The regression coefficient function for each predictor is
allowed to be dynamic, which is essential for applications where the
association between predictors and a (functional) response is time-varying. For
greater modeling flexibility, we design a nonparametric reduced-rank functional
data model with an unknown functional basis expansion, which is data-adaptive
and, unlike most existing methods, modeled as unknown for appropriate
uncertainty quantification. Within a Bayesian framework, we introduce shrinkage
priors that simultaneously (i) regularize time-varying regression coefficient
functions to be locally static, (ii) effectively remove unimportant predictor
variables from the model, and (iii) reduce sensitivity to the dimension of the
functional basis. A simulation analysis confirms the importance of these
shrinkage priors, with notable improvements over existing alternatives. We
develop a novel projection-based Gibbs sampling algorithm, which offers
unrivaled computational scalability for fully Bayesian functional regression.

succinct descriptive models for observed data. In alternative,
interdependencies among $N$ time series $\{ x_{nk}, k>0 \}_{n=1}^{N}$ are
nowadays often captured by a graph or network $G$ that in practice may be very
large. The network itself may change over time as well (i.e., as $G_k$).
Tracking brute force the changes of time varying networks presents major
challenges, including the associated computational problems. Further, a large
set of networks may not lend itself to useful analysis. This paper approximates
the time varying networks $\left\{G_k\right\}$ as weighted linear combinations
of eigennetworks. The eigennetworks are fixed building blocks that are
estimated by first learning the time series of graphs $G_k$ from the data $\{
x_{nk}, k>0 \}_{n=1}^{N}$, followed by a Principal Network Analysis procedure.
The weights of the eigennetwork representation are eigenfeatures and the time
varying networks $\left\{G_k\right\}$ describe a trajectory in eigennetwork
space. These eigentrajectories should be smooth since the networks $G_k$ vary
at a much slower rate than the data $x_{nk}$, except when structural network
shifts occur reflecting potentially an abrupt change in the underlying
application and sources of the data. Algorithms for learning the time series of
graphs $\left\{G_k\right\}$, deriving the eigennetworks, eigenfeatures and
eigentrajectories, and detecting changepoints are presented. Experiments on
simulated data and with two real time series data (a voting record of the US
senate and genetic expression data for the \textit{Drosophila Melanogaster} as

is still challenging to predict future series given historical observations and
past exogenous data. Existing methods either fail to consider the interactions
among different components of exogenous variables which may affect the
prediction accuracy, or cannot model the correlations between exogenous data
and target data. Besides, the inherent temporal dynamics of exogenous data are
also related to the target series prediction, and thus should be considered as
well. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model,
i.e., Hierarchical attention-based Recurrent Highway Network (HRHN), which
incorporates spatio-temporal feature extraction of exogenous variables and
temporal dynamics modeling of target variables into a single framework.
Moreover, by introducing the hierarchical attention mechanism, HRHN can
adaptively select the relevant exogenous features in different semantic levels.

proposed method directly learns the missing values in a bidirectional recurrent
dynamical system, without any specific assumption. The imputed values are
treated as variables of RNN graph and can be effectively updated during the
backpropagation.BRITS has three advantages: (a) it can handle multiple
correlated missing values in time series; (b) it generalizes to time series
with nonlinear dynamics underlying; (c) it provides a data-driven imputation
procedure and applies to general settings with missing data.We evaluate our

and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively
forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive

more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many
variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in
precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the
recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly
developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as
deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The
research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the
newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series
data, such as ""Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"", are superior to the traditional
algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show
that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based
algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in
error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA
indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that
the number of training times, known as ""epoch"" in deep learning, has no effect

planning often lack sufficient amounts of time-series data to estimate
statistical models for the purpose of scientific discovery. Moreover, the
available limited data are quite noisy. This presents a major challenge when
estimating time-series models that are robust to overfitting and have
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Most of the current literature in these
fields involve visualizing the time-series for noticeable structure and hard
coding them into pre-specified parametric functions. This approach is
associated with two limitations. First, given that such trends may not be
easily noticeable in small data, it is difficult to explicitly incorporate
expressive structure into the models during formulation. Second, it is
difficult to know $\textit{a priori}$ the most appropriate functional form to
use. To address these limitations, a nonparametric Bayesian approach was
proposed to implicitly capture hidden structure from time series having limited

various fields such as economics, finance, meteorology, and neuroscience. Given
this ubiquity of time series data, it is surprising that very few works on

autoregressive models with exogenous predictors (NARX), and multivariate models
such as linear or nonlinear VAR models. Sure screening properties are proved
for our methods, which depend on the moment conditions, and the strength of
dependence in the response and covariate processes, amongst other factors.
Dependence is quantified by functional dependence measures (Wu [Proc. Natl.

the observed time series into a matrix, utilizing matrix estimation to recover
missing values and de-noise observed entries, and performing linear regression
to make predictions. At the core of our analysis is a representation result,
which states that for a large model class, the transformed time series matrix
is (approximately) low-rank. In effect, this generalizes the widely used
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) in time series literature, and allows us to
establish a rigorous link between time series analysis and matrix estimation.
The key to establishing this link is constructing a Page matrix with
non-overlapping entries rather than a Hankel matrix as is commonly done in the
literature (e.g., SSA). This particular matrix structure allows us to provide
finite sample analysis for imputation and prediction, and prove the asymptotic
consistency of our method. Another salient feature of our algorithm is that it
is model agnostic with respect to both the underlying time dynamics and the
noise distribution in the observations. The noise agnostic property of our
approach allows us to recover the latent states when only given access to noisy
and partial observations a la a Hidden Markov Model; e.g., recovering the
time-varying parameter of a Poisson process without knowing that the underlying
process is Poisson. Furthermore, since our forecasting algorithm requires
regression with noisy features, our approach suggests a matrix estimation based
method - coupled with a novel, non-standard matrix estimation error metric - to
solve the error-in-variable regression problem, which could be of interest in
its own right. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that

quantifying the variation in model output with respect to changes in the

emulated over a short time period. Then, it is used in an iterative way to
predict the whole time series. A number of ways are proposed to take into

consider when developing change point analysis methods include computational
demands, difficulties arising from either limited amount of data or a large

deep learning models for time-series analysis. This is a step towards making
informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time-series, powered by deep
learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of
image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more
intuitive to visualize. Visualization in time-series domain is much more
complicated as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs as
compared to the image modality. In addition, little or no concentration has
been devoted for the development of such tools in the domain of time-series in
the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze a network from
different dimensions at different levels of abstraction which includes
identification of parts of the input that were responsible for a prediction
(including per filter saliency), importance of different filters present in the
network for a particular prediction, notion of diversity present in the network
through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation
learnt by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the
network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the
computed influence values, we demonstrate results regarding pruning of neural
networks based on the computed influence information. These representations
allow to understand the network features so that the acceptability of deep
networks for time-series data can be enhanced. This is extremely important in
domains like finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health-care,
counter-terrorism etc., where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are
equally important as the prediction itself. We assess the proposed framework
for interpretability with a set of desirable properties essential for any

for temporal dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for
cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the
dimensionality reduction objec tive. Based on requirement and application, the
temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity
metric. Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms are
considered and compared. To gain insight into temporal features that the
network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that
generates a region of interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of
the algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from diverse domains,

the aim of predicting the onset of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF). Atrial
fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia, but in many cases PAF

important to design procedures for detecting and, more importantly, predicting
PAF episodes. We propose a method for predicting PAF events whose first step
consists of a feature extraction procedure that represents each ECG as a
multi-variate time series. Successively, we design a classification framework
based on kernel similarities for multi-variate time series, capable of handling
missing data. We consider different approaches to perform classification in the
original space of the multi-variate time series and in an embedding space,

imbalanced time-series classification (ITSC) tasks. Here, this paper aimed at
tackling ITSC problems with deep learning. An adaptive cost-sensitive learning
strategy was proposed to modify temporal deep learning models. Through the
proposed strategy, classifiers could automatically assign misclassification
penalties to each class. In the experimental section, the proposed method was
utilized to modify five neural networks. They were evaluated on a large volume,
real-life and imbalanced time-series dataset with six metrics. Each single
network was also tested alone and combined with several mainstream data
samplers. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed cost-sensitive
modified networks worked well on ITSC tasks. Compared to other methods, the

methods. The vine pair-copulas are carefully selected to allow for
heteroskedasticity, which is a feature of most ordinal time series data. When
combined with flexible margins, the resulting time series models also allow for
other common features of ordinal data, such as zero inflation, multiple modes

several years, it may be unrealistic to assume stationarity throughout the span

applied to handle time series that are only locally stationary, i.e., they can
be assumed to be as stationary only over short time-windows. Surprisingly there
is little literature on point prediction for general locally stationary time
series even in model-based setups and there is no literature on the
construction of prediction intervals of locally stationary time series. We
attempt to fill this gap here as well. Both one-step-ahead point predictors and

is that all of the outgoing weights of the input data, the past lags of a
series, to the first hidden layer are zero. For estimation, we utilize a group
lasso penalty to shrink groups of input weights to zero. We also propose a
hierarchical penalty for simultaneous Granger causality and lag estimation. We
validate our approach on simulated data from both a sparse linear

fit a generalized linear model (GLM) with past data as covariate inputs. There
remain challenges to conducting inference for short time series length. By
treating the historical data as covariate inputs, standard errors of estimates
of GLM parameters computed using the empirical Fisher information do not fully
account the auto-correlation in the data. To overcome this serious limitation,
we derive the exact conditional Fisher information matrix of a general logistic
autoregressive model with endogenous covariates for any series length $T$.
Moreover, we also develop an iterative computational formula that allows for
relatively easy implementation of the proposed estimator. Our simulation
studies show that confidence intervals derived using the exact Fisher
information matrix tend to be narrower than those utilizing the empirical
Fisher information matrix while maintaining type I error rates at or below
nominal levels. Further, we establish that the exact Fisher information matrix
approaches, as T tends to infinity, the asymptotic Fisher information matrix
previously derived for binary time series data. The developed exact conditional
Fisher information matrix is applied to time-series data on respiratory rate
among a cohort of expectant mothers where it is found to provide narrower
confidence intervals for functionals of scientific interest and lead to greater
statistical power when compared to the empirical Fisher information matrix.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05483v2,math.ST
2017-11-13 13:33:46+00:00,Deep-ESN: A Multiple Projection-encoding Hierarchical Reservoir Computing Framework,"['Qianli Ma', 'Lifeng Shen', 'Garrison W. Cottrell']","As an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) model, reservoir computing
(RC) models, such as Echo State Networks, have attracted widespread attention
in the last decade. However, while they have had great success with time series
data [1], [2], many time series have a multiscale structure, which a
single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo
State Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its
ability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections.
Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional
echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA,
autoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations
into a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then
be processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers
alternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate
the effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage
of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time
series. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we
add connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical
analyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state
property (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN.
Experimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate
that Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard
ESNs and previous hierarchical ESN-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05255v1,cs.LG

of time series, estimation quickly becomes challenging. While several proposals
have been made to sparsely estimate large VAR models, the estimation of large
VARX models is under-explored. Moreover, typically these sparse proposals
involve a lasso-type penalty and do not incorporate lag selection into the
estimation procedure. As a consequence, the resulting models may be difficult
to interpret. In this paper, we propose a lag-based hierarchically sparse
estimator, called ""HVARX"", for large VARX models. We illustrate the usefulness
of HVARX on a cross-category management marketing application. Our results show

modeling, which is only compounded by the challenge of having to form such
forecasts when a time series has never previously been observed. The latter
challenge is the time series version of the cold-start problem seen in
recommender systems which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in previous
work. A similar problem occurs when a long range forecast is required after
only observing a small number of time points --- a warm start forecast. With
these aims in mind, we focus on forecasting seasonal profiles---or baseline
demand---for periods on the order of a year in three cases: the long range case
with multiple previously observed seasonal profiles, the cold start case with
no previous observed seasonal profiles, and the warm start case with only a
single partially observed profile. Classical time series approaches that
perform iterated step-ahead forecasts based on previous observations struggle
to provide accurate long range predictions; in settings with little to no
observed data, such approaches are simply not applicable. Instead, we present a
straightforward framework which combines ideas from high-dimensional regression
and matrix factorization on a carefully constructed data matrix. Key to our
formulation and resulting performance is leveraging (1) repeated patterns over
fixed periods of time and across series, and (2) metadata associated with the
individual series; without this additional data, the cold-start/warm-start

causal mediation analysis across the variables and vector autoregressive models

range of data types while retaining the interpretability of decision trees. In
particular, when a grammar based on temporal logic is used, we show that GBDTs
can be used for the interpretable classi cation of high-dimensional and
heterogeneous time series data. Furthermore, we show how GBDTs can also be used
for categorization, which is a combination of clustering and generating
interpretable explanations for each cluster. We apply GBDTs to analyze the
classic Australian Sign Language dataset as well as data on near mid-air
collisions (NMACs). The NMAC data comes from aircraft simulations used in the
development of the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS

is based on an explicit representation of the $L^2$-distance between the
spectral density operator of a non-stationary process and its best
($L^2$-)approximation by a spectral density operator corresponding to a
stationary process. This distance can easily be estimated by sums of
Hilbert-Schmidt inner products of periodogram operators (evaluated at different
frequencies), and asymptotic normality of an appropriately standardized version
of the estimator can be established for the corresponding estimate under the
null hypothesis and alternative. As a result we obtain a simple asymptotic
frequency domain level $\alpha$ test (using the quantiles of the normal
distribution) for the hypothesis of stationarity of functional time series.
Other applications such as asymptotic confidence intervals for a measure of
stationarity or the construction of tests for ""relevant deviations from
stationarity"", are also briefly mentioned. We demonstrate in a small simulation
study that the new method has very good finite sample properties. Moreover, we
apply our test to annual temperature curves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05248v2,stat.ME

linear combinations of the present and past values of the series that minimize
the reconstruction mean squared error. Previous definitions of dynamic
principal components depend on past and future values of the series. For this
reason, they are not appropriate for forecasting purposes. On the contrary, it
is shown that the ODPC introduced in this paper can be successfully used for
forecasting high-dimensional multiple time series. An alternating least squares
algorithm to compute the proposed ODPC is presented. We prove that for
stationary and ergodic time series the estimated values converge to their
population analogues. We also prove that asymptotically, when both the number
of series and the sample size go to infinity, if the data follows a dynamic
factor model, the reconstruction obtained with ODPC converges, in mean squared
error, to the common part of the factor model. Monte Carlo results shows that
forecasts obtained by the ODPC compare favourably with other forecasting

authors of this paper using the local Gaussian auto-spectrum based on the local
Gaussian auto-correlations. This makes it possible to detect local structures
in univariate time series that looks like white noise when investigated by the
ordinary auto-spectrum. In this paper the local Gaussian approach is extended
to a local Gaussian cross-spectrum for multivariate time series. The local
Gaussian cross-spectrum has the desirable property that it coincides with the
ordinary cross-spectrum for Gaussian time series, which implies that it can be
used to detect non-Gaussian traits in the time series under investigation. In
particular: If the ordinary spectrum is flat, then peaks and troughs of the

$\{Y_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ can be used to investigate whether or not periodic
structures are present in $\{Y_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$, but $f(\omega)$ has some
limitations due to its dependence on the autocovariances $\gamma(h)$. For
example, $f(\omega)$ can not distinguish white i.i.d. noise from GARCH-type
models (whose terms are dependent, but uncorrelated), which implies that
$f(\omega)$ can be an inadequate tool when $\{Y_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ contains
asymmetries and nonlinear dependencies.
  Asymmetries between the upper and lower tails of a time series can be
investigated by means of the local Gaussian autocorrelations introduced in
Tj{\o}stheim and Hufthammer (2013), and these local measures of dependence can
be used to construct the local Gaussian spectral density presented in this
paper. A key feature of the new local spectral density is that it coincides
with $f(\omega)$ for Gaussian time series, which implies that it can be used to
detect non-Gaussian traits in the time series under investigation. In

regression with unknown residual variances, where the set of active predictors
is allowed to evolve over time. To capture time-varying variable selection
uncertainty, we introduce new dynamic shrinkage priors for the time series of
regression coefficients. These priors are characterized by two main
ingredients: smooth parameter evolutions and intermittent zeroes for modeling
predictive breaks. More formally, our proposed Dynamic Spike-and-Slab (DSS)
priors are constructed as mixtures of two processes: a spike process for the
irrelevant coefficients and a slab autoregressive process for the active
coefficients. The mixing weights are themselves time-varying and depend on
lagged values of the series. Our DSS priors are probabilistically coherent in
the sense that their stationary distribution is fully known and characterized
by spike-and-slab marginals. For posterior sampling over dynamic regression
coefficients, model selection indicators as well as unknown dynamic residual
variances, we propose a Dynamic SSVS algorithm based on forward-filtering and
backward-sampling. To scale our method to large data sets, we develop a Dynamic
EMVS algorithm for MAP smoothing. We demonstrate, through simulation and a
topical macroeconomic dataset, that DSS priors are very effective at separating
active and noisy coefficients. Our fast implementation significantly extends
the reach of spike-and-slab methods to large time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00085v3,stat.ME

DeepTrend, a deep hierarchical neural network used for traffic flow prediction
which considers and extracts the time-variant trend. DeepTrend has two stacked
layers: extraction layer and prediction layer. Extraction layer, a fully
connected layer, is used to extract the time-variant trend in traffic flow by
feeding the original flow series concatenated with corresponding simple average
trend series. Prediction layer, an LSTM layer, is used to make flow prediction
by feeding the obtained trend from the output of extraction layer and
calculated residual series. To make the model more effective, DeepTrend needs

developing principled solutions for privacy in time series applications has
become increasingly important. While differential privacy is the gold standard
for database privacy, many time series applications require a different kind of

privacy to address these situations.
  However, a major barrier to using inferential privacy in practice is its lack
of graceful composition -- even if the same or related sensitive data is used
in multiple releases that are safe individually, the combined release may have
poor privacy properties. In this paper, we study composition properties of a
form of inferential privacy called Pufferfish when applied to time-series data.
We show that while general Pufferfish mechanisms may not compose gracefully, a

discovering repeated patterns in temporal data. Once these patterns have been
discovered, seemingly complicated datasets can be interpreted as a temporal
sequence of only a small number of states, or clusters. For example, raw sensor
data from a fitness-tracking application can be expressed as a timeline of a
select few actions (i.e., walking, sitting, running). However, discovering
these patterns is challenging because it requires simultaneous segmentation and
clustering of the time series. Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clusters
is difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional. Here we propose a
new method of model-based clustering, which we call Toeplitz Inverse
Covariance-based Clustering (TICC). Each cluster in the TICC method is defined
by a correlation network, or Markov random field (MRF), characterizing the
interdependencies between different observations in a typical subsequence of
that cluster. Based on this graphical representation, TICC simultaneously
segments and clusters the time series data. We solve the TICC problem through
alternating minimization, using a variation of the expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. We derive closed-form solutions to efficiently solve the two
resulting subproblems in a scalable way, through dynamic programming and the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), respectively. We validate
our approach by comparing TICC to several state-of-the-art baselines in a

outliers, large amounts of noise, or when the underlying time series changes.
  We propose a flexible model for time series analysis, using exponential
smoothing cells for overlapping time windows. The approach can detect and
remove outliers, denoise data, fill in missing observations, and provide
meaningful forecasts in challenging situations. In contrast to classic
exponential smoothing, which solves a nonconvex optimization problem over the
smoothing parameters and initial state, the proposed approach requires solving
a single structured convex optimization problem. Recent developments in
efficient convex optimization of large-scale dynamic models make the approach
tractable. We illustrate new capabilities using synthetic examples, and then

The new formulation facilitates the application of MTD to high-dimensional

logistic autoregressive model (mLTD), which while a straightforward extension
of autoregressive Bernoulli generalized linear models, has not been previously
applied to the analysis of multivariate categorial time series. We develop
novel identifiability conditions of the MTD model and compare them to those for
mLTD. We further devise novel and efficient optimization algorithm for the MTD

a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and
vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate
time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in
performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification
from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical

explore the regions of time series lengths and model-parameters where a

among applications. The precise and arbitrary timestamp can carry important
clues about the underlying dynamics, and has lent the event data fundamentally
different from the time-series whereby series is indexed with fixed and equal
time interval. One expressive mathematical tool for modeling event is point
process. The intensity functions of many point processes involve two
components: the background and the effect by the history. Due to its inherent
spontaneousness, the background can be treated as a time series while the other
need to handle the history events. In this paper, we model the background by a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with its units aligned with time series indexes
while the history effect is modeled by another RNN whose units are aligned with
asynchronous events to capture the long-range dynamics. The whole model with
event type and timestamp prediction output layers can be trained end-to-end.
Our approach takes an RNN perspective to point process, and models its
background and history effect. For utility, our method allows a black-box
treatment for modeling the intensity which is often a pre-defined parametric
form in point processes. Meanwhile end-to-end training opens the venue for

the time series but the distribution of the standardized innovations is not
influenced by the covariate and is stable in time. The joint distribution of
the time series is then determined by the conditional means, the conditional

warping paths between parameter and input time series. In general, optimal
warping paths are not unique resulting in adverse effects in theory and
practice. Under the assumption of squared error local costs, we show that no
two warping paths have identical costs almost everywhere in a measure-theoretic

are unique almost everywhere, and (ii) the set of all pairs of time series with
multiple equal-cost warping paths coincides with the union of exponentially
many zero sets of quadratic forms. One implication of the proposed results is
that typical distance-based cost functions such as the k-means objective are

Importantly, by studying the SVAR case, we are able to both provide

relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage

such estimators are undeveloped. We present methodology based on a functional
central limit theorem for conducting statistical inference for the
cross-covariance operator estimated between two stationary, weakly dependent,

be processed to create an inner time series that is unaffected by any
instantaneous invertible, possibly nonlinear transformation of the
measurements. An inner time series contains information that does not depend on
the nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.
Instead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the
observed system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may
produce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence
of sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of
non-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it
consists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series
of an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be
used to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without
using blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.
The method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the

Consequently, shapelet discovery for large time series datasets quickly becomes

time. These techniques use approximation or discretization and often lead to
reduced classification accuracy compared to the exact method.
  We are proposing the use of ensembles of shapelet-based classifiers obtained

the number of evaluated candidates and consequently the required computational
cost, while the classification accuracy of the resulting models is also not

characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique
characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one
low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in
the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build

for curves in the non-Euclidean space of Hermitian positive definite matrices,
with in mind the application to Fourier spectral estimation of multivariate
stationary time series. The main focus is on intrinsic average-interpolation
wavelet transforms in the space of positive definite matrices equipped with an
affine-invariant Riemannian metric, and convergence rates of linear wavelet
thresholding are derived for intrinsically smooth curves of Hermitian positive
definite matrices. In the context of multivariate Fourier spectral estimation,
intrinsic wavelet thresholding is equivariant under a change of basis of the
time series, and nonlinear wavelet thresholding is able to capture localized
features in the spectral density matrix across frequency, always guaranteeing
positive definite estimates. The finite-sample performance of intrinsic wavelet
thresholding is assessed by means of simulated data and compared to several
benchmark estimators in the Riemannian manifold. Further illustrations are
provided by examining the multivariate spectra of trial-replicated brain signal
time series recorded during a learning experiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03314v6,stat.ME

classification, data are captured over the course of time, constituting a
Time-Series. Time-Series often contain temporal dependencies that cause two
otherwise identical points of time to belong to different classes or predict
different behavior. This characteristic generally increases the difficulty of
analysing them. Existing techniques often depended on hand-crafted features
that were expensive to create and required expert knowledge of the field. With
the advent of Deep Learning new models of unsupervised learning of features for
Time-series analysis and forecast have been developed. Such new developments

stationarity test for functional time series based on frequency domain methods.
The proposed test statistics is based on joint dimension reduction via
functional principal components analysis across the spectral density operators
at all Fourier frequencies, explicitly allowing for frequency-dependent levels
of truncation to adapt to the dynamics of the underlying functional time
series. The properties of the test are derived both under the null hypothesis
of stationary functional time series and under the smooth alternative of
locally stationary functional time series. The methodology is theoretically
justified through asymptotic results. Evidence from simulation studies and an
application to annual temperature curves suggests that the test works well in

linear filter. To do this a functional Innovations Algorithm is utilized as a
starting point to estimate the corresponding moving average operators via
suitable projections into principal directions. In order to establish
consistency of the proposed estimators, asymptotic theory is developed for
increasing subspaces of these principal directions. For practical purposes,
several strategies to select the number of principal directions to include in
the estimation procedure as well as the choice of order of the functional

case where the response and covariates are iid elements of an infinite
dimensional Hilbert space. The unknown to be estimated is a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator, whose inverse is by definition unbounded, rendering the problem of
inference ill-posed. In this paper, we consider the more general context where
the sample of response/covariate pairs forms a weakly dependent stationary
process in the respective product Hilbert space: simply stated, the case where
we have a regression between functional time series. We consider a general
framework of potentially nonlinear processes, exploiting recent advances in the
spectral analysis of time series. Our main result is the establishment of the
rate of convergence for the corresponding estimators of the regression
coefficients, the latter forming a summable sequence in the space of
Hilbert-Schmidt operators. In a sense, our main result can be seen as a
generalisation of the classical functional linear model rates, to the case of
time series, and rests only upon cumulant mixing conditions. While the analysis
becomes considerably more involved in the dependent case, the rates are
strikingly comparable to those of the i.i.d. case, but at the expense of an

linked information among time series. For example, social network users are
considered to be social sensors that continuously generate social signals

referred to as \emph{shapelets} in a time series. Extracting shapelets for time
series classification has been widely studied. However, existing works on
shapelet selection assume that the time series are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption restricts their applications to social
networked time series analysis, since a user's actions can be correlated to
his/her social affiliations. In this paper we propose a new Network Regularized
Least Squares (NetRLS) feature selection model that combines typical time
series data and user network data for analysis. Experiments on real-world

of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) over Euclidean distance gradually diminishes as
we consider ever larger datasets. However, as we shall show, the same is not

expensive operation. In this work, we address this issue in two ways. We
propose a novel pruning strategy that exploits both the upper and lower bounds
to prune off a very large fraction of the expensive distance calculations. This
pruning strategy is admissible and gives us provably identical results to the
brute force algorithm, but is at least an order of magnitude faster. For
datasets where even this level of speedup is inadequate, we show that we can
use a simple heuristic to order the unavoidable calculations in a
most-useful-first ordering, thus casting the clustering into an anytime

a binary segmentation algorithm for multivariate time series, one natural
solution is to combine CUSUM statistics obtained from local periodograms and
cross-periodograms of the components of the input time series. However, the

properties are characterized in terms of the autocovariance and spectral
density functions. The random shock and inverted form representations are
derived. It is shown that every strongly persistent series is the dual of an
antipersistent series and vice versa. The asymptotic generalized variance of
hyperbolic decay time series with unit innovation variance is shown to be

the variables to be unobserved, revealed very encouraging performance of our

one. So far, feasible quantile regression methods for this task have been
confined to a variant of the GARCH model, the linear GARCH model, owing to its
tractable conditional quantile structure. This paper considers the widely used
GARCH model. An easy-to-implement hybrid conditional quantile estimation
procedure is developed based on a simple albeit nontrivial transformation.
Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and statistics are derived,
which facilitate corresponding inferences. To approximate the asymptotic
distribution of the quantile regression estimator, we introduce a mixed
bootstrapping procedure, where a time-consuming optimization is replaced by a
sample averaging. Moreover, diagnostic tools based on the residual quantile

variances of error terms in a time series dataset. The presence of
heteroskedasticity in data imposes serious challenges for forecasting models

Heteroskedasticity of the data affects the relation between the predictor
variable and the outcome, which leads to false positive and false negative
decisions in the hypothesis testing. Available approaches to study
heteroskedasticity thus far adopt the strategy of accommodating
heteroskedasticity in the time series and consider it an inevitable source of

normal and heteroskedastic scenarios and a statistical test is to determine
whether or not the data is heteroskedastic.
  This work-in-progress research introduces a quantifying measurement for
heteroskedasticity. The idea behind the proposed metric is the fact that a
heteroskedastic time series features a uniformly distributed local variances.
The proposed measurement is obtained by calculating the local variances using
linear time invariant filters. A probability density function of the calculated
local variances is then derived and compared to a uniform distribution of
theoretical ultimate heteroskedasticity using statistical divergence
measurements. The results demonstrated on synthetic datasets shows a strong

algorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes

for comparing imputation methods for missing data in univariate time series.
The imputeTestbench package can be used to simulate the amount and type of
missing data in a complete dataset and compare filled data using different
imputation methods. The user has the option to simulate missing data by
removing observations completely at random or in blocks of different sizes.
Several default imputation methods are included with the package, including
historical means, linear interpolation, and last observation carried forward.
The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or
remove additional methods using a simple two-step process. The testbench
compares the actual missing and imputed data for each method with different
error metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Alternative error metrics can
also be supplied by the user. The simplicity of use and significant reduction
in time to compare imputation methods for missing data in univariate time
series is a significant advantage of the package. This paper provides an
overview of the core functions, including a demonstration with examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00476v2,stat.ME

amount of literature has addressed spatio--temporal models, with Spatial
Dynamic Panel Data (SDPD) being widely investigated and applied. In real data
applications, checking the validity of the theoretical assumptions underlying
the SDPD models is essential but sometimes difficult. At other times, the
assumptions are clearly violated. For example, the spatial matrix is assumed to
be known but it may actually be unknown and needs to be estimated. In such
cases, the performance of the SDPD model's estimator is generally affected.
Motivated by such considerations, we propose a new model (called stationary
SDPD) and a new estimation procedure based on simple and clear assumptions that
can be easily checked with real data. The new model is highly adaptive, and the
estimation procedure has a rate of convergence that is not affected by the
dimension of the time series (under general assumptions), notwithstanding the
relatively high number of parameters to be estimated. The new model may be used
to represent a wide class of multivariate time series, not necessarily
spatio-temporal. So, it can be used as a valid alternative to vector
autoregressive (VAR) models with two immediate advantages: i) a faster rate of
convergence of the estimation procedure and ii) the possibility of estimating
the model even when the dimension is higher than the time series length,
overcoming the curse of dimensionality typical of the VAR models. The
simulation study shows that the new estimation procedure performs well compared
with the classic alternative procedure, even when the spatial matrix is unknown
and therefore estimated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04522v1,stat.ME

advances in robust regression and hard-thresholding methods. However, a direct
application of existing techniques is hindered by a critical difference in the
time-series domain: each point is correlated with all previous points rendering
existing tools inapplicable directly. We show how to overcome this hurdle using
novel proof techniques. Using our techniques, we are also able to provide the
first efficient and provably consistent estimator for the robust regression
problem where a standard linear observation model with white additive noise is

individual electronic health records (EHR) offer an exciting new way to study
subtle differences in the way these diseases progress over time. In this paper,
we focus on answering two questions that can be asked using these databases of
time series. First, we want to understand whether there are individuals with
similar disease trajectories and whether there are a small number of degrees of
freedom that account for differences in trajectories across the population.
Second, we want to understand how important clinical outcomes are associated
with disease trajectories. To answer these questions, we propose the Disease
Trajectory Map (DTM), a novel probabilistic model that learns low-dimensional
representations of sparse and irregularly sampled time series. We propose a
stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the DTM that allows the
model to scale to large modern medical datasets. To demonstrate the DTM, we
analyze data collected on patients with the complex autoimmune disease,

multivariate volatility structure defined by a sparse underlying graphical
model. Computational advances are especially significant in connection with
model uncertainty about the sparsity patterns among series that define this

achieved by adding a spatio-temporal compactness term to the optimization

illustrations of this. We apply these ideas to stationary univariate and
multivariate time series to measure lagged auto- and cross-dependence in a time

the sample auto- and cross-distance correlation functions. We also apply the
auto-distance correlation function (ADCF) to the residuals of an autoregressive
processes as a test of goodness of fit. Under the null that an autoregressive

proportional to the quantity's current value. Surprisingly, when exponential
growth data is plotted as a simple histogram disregarding the time dimension, a
remarkable fit to the positively skewed k/x distribution is found, where the
small is numerous and the big is rare. Such quantitative preference for the
small has a corresponding digital preference known as Benford's Law which
predicts that the first significant digit on the left-most side of numbers in
typical real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits
approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more
frequently than high digits in the first place. Exponential growth series with
high growth rate are nearly perfectly Benford given that plenty of elements are
considered. An additional constraint is that the logarithm of the growth factor
must be an irrational number. Since the irrationals vastly outnumber the
rationals, on the face of it, this constraint seems to constitute the
explanation of why almost all growth series are Benford, yet, in reality this
is all too simplistic, and the real and more complex explanation is provided in
this article. Empirical examinations of close to a half a million growth series
via computerized programs almost perfectly match the prediction of the
theoretical study on rational versus irrational occurrences, thus in a sense
confirming both, the empirical work as well as the theoretical study. In
addition, a rigorous mathematical proof is provided in the continuous growth
case showing that it exactly obeys Benford's Law. A non-rigorous proof is given

modelled as a linear function of observed regressors and a stationary latent
Gaussian process are considered. Score tests are developed to first test for
the existence of a latent process and, subsequent to that, evidence of serial
dependence in that latent process. The test for the existence of a latent
process is important because, if one is present, standard logistic regression
methods will produce inconsistent estimates of the regression parameters.
However the score test is non-standard and any serial dependence in the latent
process will require consideration of nuisance parameters which cannot be
estimated under the null hypothesis of no latent process. The paper describes
how a supremum-type test can be applied. If a latent process is detected,
consistent estimation of its variance and the regression parameters can be done
using marginal estimation which is easily implemented using generalised linear
mixed model methods. The test for serial dependence in a latent process does
not involve nuisance parameters and is based on the covariances between
residuals centered at functions of the latent process conditional on the
observations. This requires numerical integration in order to compute the test
statistic. Relevant asymptotic results are derived and confirmed using

likelihood, in which the variance of the latent process but not the serial
dependence is accounted for. In practice this is equivalent to using
generalized linear mixed model estimation procedures treating the observations
as independent with a random effect on the intercept term in the regression
model. We prove this method leads to consistent and asymptotically normal
estimates even if there is an autocorrelated latent process. Simulations
suggest that the use of marginal likelihood can lead to GLM estimates result.
This problem reduces rapidly with increasing number of binomial trials at each
time point but, for binary data, the chance of it can remain over 45% even in

methods presented allow extension of existing mixed model procedures for count
data by incorporating serial dependence which can differ in form and strength
across the individual series. The structure of the model has some similarities
to longitudinal data transition models with random effects. However, in
contrast to that setting, where there are many cases and few to moderate

hypothesis is rejected, frequency bands causing the rejection will be
identified and might usefully be related to known properties of the physical
processes. The test needs the associated spectral matrix which can be estimated
by multitaper methods using, say, $K$ tapers. Standard asymptotic distributions
for the test statistic are of no use since they would require $K \rightarrow
\infty,$ but, as $K$ increases so does resolution bandwidth which causes
spectral blurring. In many analyses $K$ is necessarily kept small, and hence
our efforts are directed at practical and accurate methodology for hypothesis
testing for small $K.$ Our generalized likelihood ratio statistic combined with
exact cumulant matching gives very accurate rejection percentages and
outperforms other methods. We also prove that the statistic on which the test

information about disease progression and kidney function. Traditionally, an
eGFR time series is interpreted by a human expert labelling it as stable or
unstable. While this approach works for individual patients, the time consuming
nature of it precludes the quick evaluation of risk in large numbers of
patients. However, automating this process poses significant challenges as eGFR
measurements are usually recorded at irregular intervals and the series of
measurements differs in length between patients. Here we present a two-tier
system to automatically classify an eGFR trend. First, we model the time series
using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fill in `gaps' by resampling a fixed
size vector of fifty time-dependent observations. Second, we classify the
resampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate its
performance via 5-fold cross validation. Using this approach we achieved an
F-score of 0.90, compared to 0.96 for 5 human experts when scored amongst

the threshold non-linear autoregressive model. It is expected that the process
of determining the commodity groups that are time-dependent will advance the
current knowledge about the dynamics of co-moving and coherent prices, and can
serve as a basis for multivariate time series analyses. The clustering of
commodity prices was examined using the proposed clustering approach based on
time series models to incorporate the time varying properties of price series
into the clustering scheme. Accordingly, the primary aim in this study was
grouping time series according to the similarity between their Data Generating
Mechanisms (DGMs) rather than comparing pattern similarities in the time series
traces. The approximation to the DGM of each series was accomplished using
threshold autoregressive models, which are recognized for their ability to
represent nonlinear features in time series, such as abrupt changes,
time-irreversibility and regime-shifting behavior. Through the use of the
proposed approach, one can determine and monitor the set of co-moving time
series variables across the time dimension. Furthermore, generating a time
varying commodity price index and sub-indexes can become possible.
Consequently, we conducted a simulation study to assess the effectiveness of
the proposed clustering approach and the results are presented for both the

processes is to carry out analysis for time series with dependency structure in
a computationally tractable way. Another challenge is that the number of true
change points is usually unknown, requiring a suitable model selection
criterion to arrive at informative conclusions. To address the first challenge,
we model the data generating process as a segment-wise autoregression, which is
composed of several segments (time epochs), each of which modeled by an
autoregressive model. We propose a multi-window method that is both effective
and efficient for discovering the structural changes. The proposed approach was
motivated by transforming a segment-wise autoregression into a multivariate
time series that is asymptotically segment-wise independent and identically
distributed. To address the second challenge, we derive theoretical guarantees
for (almost surely) selecting the true number of change points of segment-wise
independent multivariate time series. Specifically, under mild assumptions, we
show that a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)-like criterion gives a
strongly consistent selection of the optimal number of change points, while an
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-like criterion cannot. Finally, we
demonstrate the theory and strength of the proposed algorithms by experiments
on both synthetic and real-world data, including the Eastern US temperature
data and the El Nino data from 1854 to 2015. The experiment leads to some
interesting discoveries about temporal variability of the summer-time

estimate structural relations among components of well-being. Each ordinal

likelihood based on evaluating the multidimensional integrals of the likelihood
with randomized quasi Monte Carlo methods is used for the estimation.
Asymptotic calculations show that our method is nearly as efficient as maximum
likelihood for fully specified multivariate copula models. Our findings
highlight the importance of one's relative position in evaluating their
well-being with no direct effects of socio-economic characteristics on
well-being but strong indirect effects through their impact on components of

temporal sampling, long range dependencies, and scale. Moreover, real-world
data is often collected at irregular time intervals across vast arrays of
decentralized sensors and with long range dependencies which make naive time

are essentially equivalent to vector autoregressive moving average-type models.
However, NARIMA models are especially useful when the structure of the graph,
associated with the multivariate time series, changes over time. Such network
topology changes are invisible to standard VARMA-like models. For integrated
NARIMA models we introduce network differencing, based on the network lifting
(wavelet) transform, which removes trend. We exhibit our techniques on a

network lifting on a simple bivariate VAR(1) model with associated two-node

Nevertheless, the orthogonality does not hold for transformations of

transformations of linear processes, which include the FARIMA(p,d,q) processes,

stationary processes, the transformations of short-memory time series still
have short-memory and the transformation of long-memory time series may have
different weaker memory parameters which depend on the power rank of the
transformation. On the other hand, the memory properties of transformations of
non-stationary time series may not depend on the power ranks of the

efficient for image classification. In this paper, we design a time series
classification scheme that builds on the SIFT framework adapted to time series
to feed a Bag-of-Words. We then refine our method by studying the impact of
normalized Bag-of-Words, as well as densely extract point descriptors. Proposed
adjustements achieve better performance. The evaluation shows that our method

models which is fairly general and, for example, covers models going from ARMA
to state-space models. This approach provides estimators which are (i)
consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, (ii) applicable to various
classes of time series models, (iii) straightforward to implement and (iv)
computationally efficient. The framework is based on the recently developed
Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) and a new robust estimator of the
wavelet variance. Compared to existing methods, the latter directly estimates
the quantity of interest while performing better in finite samples and using
milder conditions for its asymptotic properties to hold. Moreover, results are
given showing the identifiability of the GMWM for various classes of time
series models thereby allowing this method to consistently estimate many models
(and combinations thereof) under mild conditions. Hence, not only does this
paper provide an alternative estimator which allows to perform wavelet variance
analysis when data are contaminated but also a general approach to robustly
estimate the parameters of a variety of (latent) time series models. The
simulation studies carried out confirm the better performance of the proposed
estimators and the usefulness and broadness of the proposed methodology is
shown using practical examples from the domains of economics and engineering

Bayesian state-space model for non-stationary time series datasets where both
the trend and seasonal components are present and it is the general scenario
for most of the real datasets in various scientific disciplines. In spite of
removing such terms using some do-and-check procedure to make the data
stationary, our model directly fits a dataset and forecasts a number of future
observations. For a specific prior construction we have considered, every
parameter update is one-dimensional so that we don't need to invert any matrix
and also we overcome the difficulty of Metropolis-Hastings steps simply by
Gibbs sampling which is another advantage of this model. It can handle missing
data as well which occurs very often in time series contexts. We implement it
on the sufficiently large (24 years of monthly average temperature series, i.e.
the number of observations =288) for 57 meteorological stations across India

the months of the 25-th year.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02149v1,stat.ME

extremes of a stationary time series. There are standard approaches to marginal
modelling, but long- and short-range dependence of extremes may both appear. In
applications, an assumption of long-range independence often seems reasonable,
but short-range dependence, i.e., the clustering of extremes, needs attention.
The extremal index $0<\theta\le 1$ is a natural limiting measure of clustering,
but for wide classes of dependent processes, including all stationary Gaussian
processes, it cannot distinguish dependent processes from independent processes
with $\theta=1$. Eastoe and Tawn (2012) exploit methods from multivariate
extremes to treat the subasymptotic extremal dependence structure of stationary
time series, covering both $0<\theta<1$ and $\theta=1$, through the
introduction of a threshold-based extremal index. Inference for their
dependence models uses an inefficient stepwise procedure that has various
weaknesses and has no reliable assessment of uncertainty. We overcome these
issues using a Bayesian semiparametric approach. Simulations and the analysis
of a UK daily river flow time series show that the new approach provides
improved efficiency for estimating properties of functionals of clusters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01169v2,stat.ME

complexity in the analysis of time series data, especially in physiology and
medicine. Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of
regularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to
quantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as
determine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current
entropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,
a high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score
indicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that
current entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,
or conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the
possibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or
permutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.
This paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based
measurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale
entropy. Our experimental results indicate that the test statistics of the runs
test and permutation test are often highly correlated with entropy scores and
may be able to provide further information regarding the complexity of time

composite covariance kernel with a single time-series data set often results in
less informative kernel that may not give qualitative, distinctive descriptions
of data. We address this challenge by proposing two relational kernel learning

independent. Both assumptions are only approximately true.
  For general triangular arrays of block maxima attracted to the Fr\'echet

maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters of the limiting Fr\'echet

structure of the underlying systems of multi-variate time series. In
particular, the direct causal effects are commonly estimated by the conditional
Granger causality index (CGCI). In the presence of many observed variables and
relatively short time series, CGCI may fail because it is based on vector
autoregressive models (VAR) involving a large number of coefficients to be
estimated. In this work, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the
recently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged
variables and the CGCI is combined with BTS. Further, the proposed approach is
compared favorably to other restricted VAR representations, such as the
top-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy, and the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO), in terms of sensitivity and specificity of CGCI.
This is shown by using simulations of linear and nonlinear, low and
high-dimensional systems and different time series lengths. For nonlinear
systems, CGCI from the restricted VAR representations are compared with
analogous nonlinear causality indices. Further, CGCI in conjunction with BTS
and other restricted VAR representations is applied to multi-channel scalp
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients containing

machines or kernel based regression has been proved to be consistent for
certain classes of discrete dynamical systems. Consistency implies that these
methods are effective at computing the expected value of a point at a future
time given the present coordinates. However, the present coordinates themselves
are noisy, and therefore, these methods are not necessarily effective at
removing noise. In this article, we consider denoising and prediction as
separate problems for flows, as opposed to discrete time dynamical systems, and
show that the use of smooth splines is more effective at removing noise.
Combination of smooth splines and kernel based regression yields predictors
that are more accurate on benchmarks typically by a factor of 2 or more. We
prove that kernel based regression in combination with smooth splines converges
to the exact predictor for time series extracted from any compact invariant set
of any sufficiently smooth flow. As a consequence of convergence, one can find
examples where the combination of kernel based regression with smooth splines
is superior by even a factor of $100$. The predictors that we compute operate

domains, including health care and network monitoring. A common approach to

ensure robustness the window size needs to be large, which not only leads to
missed alarms but also increases runtime.
  To this end, we propose LIGHT, a linear-time algorithm for robustly detecting
non-linear changes in massively high dimensional time series. Importantly,
LIGHT provides high flexibility in choosing the window size, allowing the
domain expert to fit the level of details required. To do such, we 1) perform
scalable PCA to reduce dimensionality, 2) perform scalable factorization of the
joint distribution, and 3) scalably compute divergences between these lower

an ""indicator"" with two key properties: conditional independence of the outcome
(given exposure and measured covariates) absent confounding and other model
miss-specification; and an association with unmeasured confounders (like the
exposure). We now present a new method for correcting for residual confounding
in time-series and other epidemiological studies. We argue that estimators from
models that include an indicator with these key properties should have less
bias than those from models without the indicator.
  Methods: Using causal reasoning and basic regression theory we present
theoretical arguments to support our claims. In simulations, we empirically
evaluate our approach using a time-series study of ozone effects on emergency
department visits for asthma (AV). We base simulations on observed data for
ozone, meteorological factors and asthma.
  Results: In simulations, results from models that included ozone
concentrations one day after the AV yielded effect estimators with slightly or
modestly less residual confounding.
  Conclusion: Theory and simulations show that including the indicator based on
future air pollution levels can reduce residual confounding. Our method differs
from available methods because it uses a regression approach involving an
exposure-based indicator rather than a negative outcome control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06905v1,stat.ME

advantage of such structure without making model assumptions about how distance

approach reduces the statistical error. An application to air pollution in the
US demonstrates that the estimation approach reduces both computing time and
prediction error and gives rise to results that are meaningful from a

the goal of using frequency domain properties to discriminate between the
groups. In many applications, there exists variation in cyclical patterns from
time series in the same group. Although a number of frequency domain methods
for the discriminant analysis of time series have been explored, there is a
dearth of models and methods that account for within-group spectral
variability. This article proposes a model for groups of time series in which
transfer functions are modeled as stochastic variables that can account for
both between-group and within-group differences in spectra that are identified
from individual replicates. An ensuing discriminant analysis of stochastic
cepstra under this model is developed to obtain parsimonious measures of
relative power that optimally separate groups in the presence of within-group
spectral variability. The approach possess favorable properties in classifying
new observations and can be consistently estimated through a simple
discriminant analysis of a finite number of estimated cepstral coefficients.
Benefits in accounting for within-group spectral variability are empirically

community detection in complex networks. Firstly, we present a method to
transform a set of time series into a network using different distance
functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most
similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to
identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and,
consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a
comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series
distance functions, network generation methods and community detection
techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed
network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or
up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm
that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such
as $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data
sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns
presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying
network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other
techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is
robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time
shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed
method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to

Typical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures rely on the use of
max-pooling operators in between layers, which leads to reduced resolution at
the top layers. Instead, in this work we consider a fully convolutional network
(FCN) architecture that uses causal filtering operations, and allows for the
rate of the output signal to be the same as that of the input signal. We
furthermore propose an undecimated version of the FCN, which we refer to as the
undecimated fully convolutional neural network (UFCNN), and is motivated by the
undecimated wavelet transform. Our experimental results verify that using the
undecimated version of the FCN is necessary in order to allow for effective
time-series modeling. The UFCNN has several advantages compared to other
time-series models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long
short-term memory (LSTM), since it does not suffer from either the vanishing or
exploding gradients problems, and is therefore easier to train. Convolution
operations can also be implemented more efficiently compared to the recursion
that is involved in RNN-based models. We evaluate the performance of our model
in a synthetic target tracking task using bearing only measurements generated
from a state-space model, a probabilistic modeling of polyphonic music
sequences problem, and a high frequency trading task using a time-series of

extremely important in a range of machine learning task, not least of all with
regards to classification and clustering. While there exist many feature
extraction techniques suitable for non-intermittent time-series data, these
approaches are not always appropriate for intermittent time-series data, where
intermittency is characterized by constant values for large periods of time
punctuated by sharp and transient increases or decreases in value.
  Motivated by this, we present aggregation, mode decomposition and projection
(AMP) a feature extraction technique particularly suited to intermittent
time-series data which contain time-frequency patterns. For our method all
individual time-series within a set are combined to form a non-intermittent
aggregate. This is decomposed into a set of components which represent the
intrinsic time-frequency signals within the data set. Individual time-series
can then be fit to these components to obtain a set of numerical features that
represent their intrinsic time-frequency patterns. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AMP, we evaluate against the real word task of clustering
intermittent time-series data. Using synthetically generated data we show that
a clustering approach which uses the features derived from AMP significantly

stylized models we show that inference based on cross-sectional data alone
generally fails to correctly account for decision making of rational agents
facing aggregate uncertainty. We propose an econometric framework that
overcomes these problems by explicitly parameterizing the agents' inference
problem relative to aggregate shocks. Our framework and examples illustrate
that the cross-sectional and time-series aspects of the model are often
interdependent. Therefore, estimation of model parameters in the presence of
aggregate shocks requires the combined use of cross-sectional and time series
data. We provide easy-to-use formulas for test statistics and confidence
intervals that account for the interaction between the cross-sectional and
time-series variation. Lastly, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that
highlight the properties of the proposed method and the risks of not properly
accounting for the presence of aggregate shocks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04415v3,stat.ME

that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is almost surely consistent

high dimensional. The paper's focus is twofold. First, we address the subject
of consistently estimating the autocovariance sequence; this is a sequence of
matrices that we conveniently stack into one huge matrix. We are then able to
show consistency of an estimator based on the so-called flat-top tapers; most
importantly, the consistency holds true even when the time series dimension is
allowed to increase with the sample size. Second, we revisit the linear process
bootstrap (LPB) procedure proposed by McMurry and Politis [J. Time Series Anal.
31 (2010) 471-482] for univariate time series. Based on the aforementioned
stacked autocovariance matrix estimator, we are able to define a version of the
LPB that is valid for multivariate time series. Under rather general
assumptions, we show that our multivariate linear process bootstrap (MLPB) has
asymptotic validity for the sample mean in two important cases: (a) when the
time series dimension is fixed and (b) when it is allowed to increase with

Functional-coefficient autoregressive models (FCAR) are useful structures for
reducing the size of the class of these models. Although this structure reduces
the class of nonlinear models, it is broad enough to include some common time
series models as specific cases. A recent development in estimating nonlinear
time series data is the spline backfitted kernel (SBK) method. This method
combines the computational speed of splines with the asymptotic properties of
kernel smoothing. To estimate a component function in the model, all other
component functions are pre-estimated with splines and then the difference is
taken of the observed time series and the pre-estimates. This difference is
then used as pseudo-responses for which kernel smoothing is used to estimate
the function of interest. By constructing the estimates in this way, the method
does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we adapt the

reconsider the concept of time elastic centroid (TEC) for a set of time series.
From this perspective, we show first how TEC can easily be addressed as a
preimage problem. Unfortunately this preimage problem is ill-posed, may suffer
from over-fitting especially for long time series and getting a sub-optimal
solution involves heavy computational costs. We then derive two new algorithms
based on a probabilistic interpretation of kernel alignment matrices that
expresses in terms of probabilistic distributions over sets of alignment paths.
The first algorithm is an iterative agglomerative heuristics inspired from the
state of the art DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) algorithm proposed specifically
for the Dynamic Time Warping measure. The second proposed algorithm achieves a
classical averaging of the aligned samples but also implements an averaging of
the time of occurrences of the aligned samples. It exploits a straightforward
progressive agglomerative heuristics. An experimentation that compares for 45
time series datasets classification error rates obtained by first near
neighbors classifiers exploiting a single medoid or centroid estimate to
represent each categories show that: i) centroids based approaches
significantly outperform medoids based approaches, ii) on the considered

applications as well as its theory. Change point analysis is a statistical tool
that aims to attain homogeneity within time series data. This is accomplished
through partitioning the time series into a number of contiguous homogeneous
segments. The applications of such techniques range from identifying chromosome
alterations to solar flare detection. In this manuscript we present a general
purpose search algorithm called cp3o that can be used to identify change points
in multivariate time series. This new search procedure can be applied with a
large class of goodness of fit measures. Additionally, a reduction in the
computational time needed to identify change points is accomplish by means of
probabilistic pruning. With mild assumptions about the goodness of fit measure
this new search algorithm is shown to generate consistent estimates for both
the number of change points and their locations, even when the number of change
points increases with the time series length.
  A change point algorithm that incorporates the cp3o search algorithm and
E-Statistics, e-cp3o, is also presented. The only distributional assumption
that the e-cp3o procedure makes is that the absolute $\alpha$th moment exists,
for some $\alpha\in(0,2)$. Due to this mild restriction, the e-cp3o procedure
can be applied to a majority of change point problems. Furthermore, even with
such a mild restriction, the e-cp3o procedure has the ability to detect any
type of distributional change within a time series. Simulation studies are used

data, less attention has been paid to time series. The goal in this setting is
to determine conditional independence relations between entire time series,
which for stationary series, are encoded by zeros in the inverse spectral
density matrix. We take a Bayesian approach to structure learning, placing
priors on (i) the graph structure and (ii) spectral matrices given the graph.
We leverage a Whittle likelihood approximation and define a conjugate
prior---the hyper complex inverse Wishart---on the complex-valued and
graph-constrained spectral matrices. Due to conjugacy, we can analytically
marginalize the spectral matrices and obtain a closed-form marginal likelihood
of the time series given a graph. Importantly, our analytic marginal likelihood
allows us to avoid inference of the complex spectral matrices themselves and
places us back into the framework of standard (Bayesian) structure learning. In
particular, combining this marginal likelihood with our graph prior leads to
efficient inference of the time series graph itself, which we base on a
stochastic search procedure, though any standard approach can be

bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently.

data. A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly
predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the
prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates
typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of
shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that
avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean
distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition,
our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out
only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence
on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4
orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery
method, while providing better prediction accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03238v1,cs.LG

described via some L{\'e}vy copula. We prove a series representation for our

motifs, has received continuous and increasing attention from diverse
scientific communities. In particular, recent approaches for discovering
similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show
that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared,
and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find
that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies
on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected
by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally
non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure.
Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure
their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the
dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that
depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability
of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series,
and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a
more broad context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01883v1,cs.LG

Fourier methods are not suitable for the analysis of nonlinear and
nonstationary data. In this paper, we propose a Fourier Decomposition Method
(FDM) and demonstrate its efficacy for the analysis of nonlinear (i.e. data
generated by nonlinear systems) and nonstationary time series. The proposed FDM
decomposes any data into a small number of `Fourier intrinsic band functions'

amplitudes and frequencies of a time series by the Fourier method itself. We
propose an idea of zero-phase filter bank based multivariate FDM (MFDM)
algorithm, for the analysis of multivariate nonlinear and nonstationary time
series, from the FDM. We also present an algorithm to obtain cutoff frequencies
for MFDM. The MFDM algorithm is generating finite number of band limited
multivariate FIBFs (MFIBFs). The MFDM preserves some intrinsic physical
properties of the multivariate data, such as scale alignment, trend and
instantaneous frequency. The proposed methods produce the results in a
time-frequency-energy distribution that reveal the intrinsic structures of a

statistics due to the increasing impact of big data. Especially time series
analysis benefits from efficient and rapid estimation techniques such as the
lasso. However, currently lasso type estimators for autoregressive time series
models still focus on models with homoscedastic residuals. Therefore, an
iteratively reweighted adaptive lasso algorithm for the estimation of time
series models under conditional heteroscedasticity is presented in a
high-dimensional setting. The asymptotic behaviour of the resulting estimator
is analysed. It is found that the proposed estimation procedure performs
substantially better than its homoscedastic counterpart. A special case of the

extend functions on time series to matrix spaces. Necessary conditions are
presented under which generalized gradient learning on time series is
consistent. We indicate how results carry over to arbitrary elastic distance

parameters. We propose estimators for these parameters, and we calculate their
asymptotic distributions. Furthermore, we derive a test for structural breaks
within the dependence structure. All results are supplemented by simulation
studies and empirical examples.
  For three consecutive data points attaining different values, there are six
possibilities how their values can be ordered. These possibilities are called
ordinal patterns. Our first idea is simply to count the number of coincidences
of patterns in both time series, and to compare this with the expected number
in the case of independence. If we detect a lot of coincident patterns, this
means that the up-and-down behavior is similar. Hence, our concept can be seen
as a way to measure non-linear `correlation'. We show in the last section, how

The oscillatory behavior of the series is thus considered the central

a Rao-Blackwell estimator, and using random matrix theory we derive its form.
Such estimators can be used to better estimate inverse spectral (precision)
matrices too, and a random matrix method has previously been proposed and
implemented via extensive simulations. We describe the method, but carry out
computations entirely analytically, and suggest a way of selecting an important
parameter using a predictive risk approach. We show that both the Rao-Blackwell

joint estimation of the model parameters, provides exact inference (up to MCMC

Sampling from the posterior distribution is accomplished with an efficient

vector time series in the sense that we seek for a contemporaneous linear
transformation for a $p$-variate time series such that the transformed series
is segmented into several lower-dimensional subseries, and those subseries are
uncorrelated with each other both contemporaneously and serially. Therefore
those lower-dimensional series can be analysed separately as far as the linear
dynamic structure is concerned. Technically it boils down to an eigenanalysis
for a positive definite matrix. When $p$ is large, an additional step is
required to perform a permutation in terms of either maximum cross-correlations
or FDR based on multiple tests. The asymptotic theory is established for both
fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity.
Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data sets indicate that the
proposed method is an effective initial step in analysing multiple time series
data, which leads to substantial dimension reduction in modelling and
forecasting high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. Unlike PCA for
independent data, there is no guarantee that the required linear transformation

gLASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum
(approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our approach is
nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional (e.g., an
autoregressive) parametric model for the observed process. Instead, we require
the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian
processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by
deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails to

changepoints in long time-series, or equivalent, data. Many common approaches
to detecting changepoints, for example based on penalised likelihood or minimum
description length, can be formulated in terms of minimising a cost over
segmentations. Dynamic programming methods exist to solve this minimisation
problem exactly, but these tend to scale at least quadratically in the length
of the time-series. Algorithms, such as Binary Segmentation, exist that have a
computational cost that is close to linear in the length of the time-series,
but these are not guaranteed to find the optimal segmentation. Recently pruning
ideas have been suggested that can speed up the dynamic programming algorithms,
whilst still being guaranteed to find true minimum of the cost function. Here
we extend these pruning methods, and introduce two new algorithms for
segmenting data, FPOP and SNIP. Empirical results show that FPOP is
substantially faster than existing dynamic programming methods, and unlike the
existing methods its computational efficiency is robust to the number of
changepoints in the data. We evaluate the method at detecting Copy Number
Variations and observe that FPOP has a computational cost that is competitive

characterized by similar waveform patterns re-appearing within one or more
sensors. Further such patterns can be of variable duration. In this work, we
propose a method for detecting such events in time-series data using a novel
feature descriptor motivated by similar ideas in image processing. We define
the shape histogram: a constant dimension descriptor that nevertheless captures
patterns of variable duration. We demonstrate the efficacy of using shape
histograms as features to detect events in an SVM-based, multi-sensor,
supervised learning scenario, i.e., multiple time-series are used to detect an
event. We present results on real-life vehicular sensor data and show that our
technique performs better than available pattern detection implementations on

sensors resulting in better accuracy than using any single sensor. Since
previous work on pattern detection in time-series has been in the single series

household usage.
  We propose three algorithms for finding motif sets. Two are greedy algorithms
based on pairwise comparison, and the third uses a heuristic measure of set
quality to find the motif set directly. We compare these algorithms on
simulated datasets and on electricity-usage data. We show that Scan MK, the
simplest way of using the best-matching pair to find motif sets, is less

only weak assumptions on both the change-points structure across series, and
the statistical signal distributions. Specifically change-points are not
assumed to occur at simultaneous time instants across series, and no specific
distribution is assumed on the individual signals. It relies on the combination
of a local robust statistical test acting on individual time segments, with a
global Bayesian framework able to optimize configurations from multiple local
statistics (from segments of a unique time series or multiple time series).
Using an extensive experimental set-up, our algorithm is shown to perform well

alternative distance measures for nearest neighbour classifiers. It is standard

distance measures for TSC~\cite{lines14elastic}, we perform a series of
experiments to test whether this standard practice is valid.
  Specifically, we compare 1-NN classifiers with Euclidean and DTW distance to
standard classifiers, examine whether the performance of 1-NN Euclidean
approaches that of 1-NN DTW as the number of cases increases, assess whether
there is any benefit of setting $k$ for $k$-NN through cross validation whether
it is worth setting the warping path for DTW through cross validation and
finally is it better to use a window or weighting for DTW. Based on experiments

the success of reducing the risk when making power system planning and
operational decisions by providing a range rather than point estimation. In
this study, a novel modeling framework integrating bivariate empirical mode
decomposition (BEMD) and support vector regression (SVR), extended from the
well-established empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based time series modeling
framework in the energy demand forecasting literature, is proposed for interval
forecasting of electricity demand. The novelty of this study arises from the
employment of BEMD, a new extension of classical empirical model decomposition
(EMD) destined to handle bivariate time series treated as complex-valued time
series, as decomposition method instead of classical EMD only capable of
decomposing one-dimensional single-valued time series. This proposed modeling
framework is endowed with BEMD to decompose simultaneously both the lower and
upper bounds time series, constructed in forms of complex-valued time series,
of electricity demand on a monthly per hour basis, resulting in capturing the
potential interrelationship between lower and upper bounds. The proposed
modeling framework is justified with monthly interval-valued electricity demand
data per hour in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, indicating
it as a promising method for interval-valued electricity demand forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3792v1,cs.LG

key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the

uniform confidence band for mean vector; (2) specification testing on the

testing of covariance matrix; (3) specification testing on the spectral
property of time series. In theory, we first derive a Gaussian approximation

such models, one must impose restrictions on the coefficient matrices to ensure
that certain determinants are nonzero; which, except in special cases, may

observed $p$ time series are linear combinations of $p$ latent uncorrelated
weakly stationary time series. The aim is then to find an estimate for an
unmixing matrix, which transforms the observed time series back to uncorrelated

only can account for covariance-related serial dependencies, and they require
second-order stationarity. Much attention has been devoted lately to
quantile-based spectral methods that go beyond covariance-based serial

stationarity into much weaker {\it local stationarity} conditions have been
developed for a variety of time-series models. Here, we are combining those two

asymmetric between the two parties and, particularly, if the process underlying
X1 does not depend on X2, then the resulting causality from X2 to X1 vanishes.
The formula is tight in form, involving only the commonly used statistics,
sample covariances. It has been validated with touchstone series purportedly

tailored stochastic coordinate descent optimization is applied. The time-series

various sliding window sizes are concatenated in order to encapsulate the

requirement for computing conditional predictive intervals. Using simulation

high-dimensional time series datasets. However, theoretical studies in
high-dimensional statistics to date rely primarily on the assumption of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In this work, we
focus on stable Gaussian processes and investigate the theoretical properties
of $\ell _1$-regularized estimates in two important statistical problems in the
context of high-dimensional time series: (a) stochastic regression with
serially correlated errors and (b) transition matrix estimation in vector
autoregressive (VAR) models. We derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the
estimation errors of the regularized estimates and establish that consistent
estimation under high-dimensional scaling is possible via
$\ell_1$-regularization for a large class of stable processes under sparsity
constraints. A key technical contribution of the work is to introduce a measure
of stability for stationary processes using their spectral properties that
provides insight into the effect of dependence on the accuracy of the
regularized estimates. With this proposed stability measure, we establish some
useful deviation bounds for dependent data, which can be used to study several
important regularized estimates in a time series setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4175v3,math.ST

between dynamics of prices and sell volumes, between growth patterns of
competitive companies, between well production data in oilfields, between wind
velocity and air pollution concentration etc. The paper develops a theoretical
basis for analysis and construction of time series shape association measures.
Starting from the axioms of time series shape association measures it studies
the methods of construction of measures satisfying these axioms. Several
general methods of construction of such measures suitable for measuring time
series shape similarity and shape association are proposed. Time series shape
association measures based on Minkowski distance and data standardization
methods are considered. The cosine similarity and the Pearsons correlation

the inverse Wishart distribution to allow for a more convenient correlation

Pearson correlation coefficient complicate an interpretation and propose a

perspective on time series analysis. In its most abstract form, a mixed
membership model aims to associate an individual entity with some set of
attributes based on a collection of observed data. Although much of the
literature on mixed membership models considers the setting in which
exchangeable collections of data are associated with each member of a set of
entities, it is equally natural to consider problems in which an entire time
series is viewed as an entity and the goal is to characterize the time series
in terms of a set of underlying dynamic attributes or ""dynamic regimes"".
Indeed, this perspective is already present in the classical hidden Markov
model, where the dynamic regimes are referred to as ""states"", and the
collection of states realized in a sample path of the underlying process can be
viewed as a mixed membership characterization of the observed time series. Our
goal here is to review some of the richer modeling possibilities for time
series that are provided by recent developments in the mixed membership
framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.3533v1,stat.ME

multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance function of a multivariate
(second- order) piecewise stationary process, which also identifies the
components of the series where the breaks occur. The new method is based on a
comparison of the estimated spectral distribution on different segments of the
observed time series and consists of three steps: it starts with a consistent
test, which allows to prove the existence of structural breaks at a controlled
type I error. Secondly, it estimates sets containing possible break points and
finally these sets are reduced to identify the relevant structural breaks and
corresponding components which are responsible for the changes in the
autocovariance structure. In contrast to all other methods which have been
proposed in the literature, our approach does not make any parametric
assumptions, is not especially designed for detecting one single change point
and addresses the problem of multiple structural breaks in the autocovariance
function directly with no use of the binary segmentation algorithm. We prove
that the new procedure detects all components and the corresponding locations
where structural breaks occur with probability converging to one as the sample
size increases and provide data-driven rules for the selection of all
regularization parameters. The results are illustrated by analyzing financial
returns, and in a simulation study it is demonstrated that the new procedure
outperforms the currently available nonparametric methods for detecting breaks

modified CUSUM procedures for the detection of abrupt changes in the regression

with their salient features. In this thesis, we have described three important
classes of time series models, viz. the stochastic, neural networks and SVM
based models, together with their inherent forecasting strengths and
weaknesses. We have also discussed about the basic issues related to time
series modeling, such as stationarity, parsimony, overfitting, etc. Our
discussion about different time series models is supported by giving the
experimental forecast results, performed on six real time series datasets.
While fitting a model to a dataset, special care is taken to select the most
parsimonious one. To evaluate forecast accuracy as well as to compare among
different models fitted to a time series, we have used the five performance
measures, viz. MSE, MAD, RMSE, MAPE and Theil's U-statistics. For each of the
six datasets, we have shown the obtained forecast diagram which graphically
depicts the closeness between the original and forecasted observations. To have
authenticity as well as clarity in our discussion about time series modeling
and forecasting, we have taken the help of various published research works
from reputed journals and some standard books.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6613v1,cs.LG

assessment of their integrity. We present a general method for inference about
system state and associated model variance structure from spatially distributed
time series which are typically short, irregular, incomplete and not directly
observable. Bayes linear analysis simplifies parameter estimation and avoids
often-unrealistic distributional assumptions. Second-order exchangeability
judgements facilitate variance learning for sparse inspection time-series. The
model is applied to inspection data for minimum wall thickness from corroding
pipe-work networks on a full-scale offshore platform, and shown to give
materially different forecasts of remnant life compared to an equivalent model

regressors and a regression function that changes smoothly over time. These
models are a natural extension of time series models with time-varying
coefficients. We introduce a kernel-based method to estimate the time-varying
regression function and provide asymptotic theory for our estimates. Moreover,
we show that the main conditions of the theory are satisfied for a large class
of nonlinear autoregressive processes with a time-varying regression function.
Finally, we examine structured models where the regression function splits up
into time-varying additive components. As will be seen, estimation in these
models does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4198v1,math.ST

practice with performance often competitive with or better than more elaborate
methods such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.
We develop theoretical justification for the effectiveness of
nearest-neighbor-like classification of time series. Our guiding hypothesis is
that in many applications, such as forecasting which topics will become trends
on Twitter, there aren't actually that many prototypical time series to begin
with, relative to the number of time series we have access to, e.g., topics
become trends on Twitter only in a few distinct manners whereas we can collect
massive amounts of Twitter data. To operationalize this hypothesis, we propose
a latent source model for time series, which naturally leads to a ""weighted
majority voting"" classification rule that can be approximated by a
nearest-neighbor classifier. We establish nonasymptotic performance guarantees
of both weighted majority voting and nearest-neighbor classification under our
model accounting for how much of the time series we observe and the model
complexity. Experimental results on synthetic data show weighted majority
voting achieving the same misclassification rate as nearest-neighbor
classification while observing less of the time series. We then use weighted
majority to forecast which news topics on Twitter become trends, where we are
able to detect such ""trending topics"" in advance of Twitter 79% of the time,
with a mean early advantage of 1 hour and 26 minutes, a true positive rate of
95%, and a false positive rate of 4%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.3639v5,stat.ML

for time series classification. TSF employs a combination of the entropy gain
and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance)
gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance
gain criterion improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at
each tree node and has a computational complexity linear in the length of a
time series and can be built using parallel computing techniques such as
multi-core computing used here. The temporal importance curve is also proposed
to capture the important temporal characteristics useful for classification.
Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean,
deviation and slope outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor
classifiers with dynamic time warping, is computationally efficient, and can
provide insights into the temporal characteristics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.2277v2,cs.LG

Boxplots. The aim is to summarize a set of streaming time series splitted in

Boxplot micro-clusters; then it reveals the final summarization by processing,
off-line, the functional data structures. Our main contribute consists in
providing a new definition of micro-cluster based on Functional Boxplots and,
in defining a proximity measure which allows to compare and update them. This
allows to get a finer graphical summarization of the streaming time series by
five functional basic statistics of data. The obtained synthesis will be able

(EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals has attracted great interest in
the community of biomedical engineering due to its important applications in
medicine. In this work, a simple yet effective bag-of-words representation that
is able to capture both local and global structure similarity information is
proposed for biomedical time series representation. In particular, similar to
the bag-of-words model used in text document domain, the proposed method treats
a time series as a text document and extracts local segments from the time
series as words. The biomedical time series is then represented as a histogram
of codewords, each entry of which is the count of a codeword appeared in the
time series. Although the temporal order of the local segments is ignored, the
bag-of-words representation is able to capture high-level structural
information because both local and global structural information are well
utilized. The performance of the bag-of-words model is validated on three
datasets extracted from real EEG and ECG signals. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is not only insensitive to parameters of
the bag-of-words model such as local segment length and codebook size, but also
robust to noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2262v1,cs.LG

aggregated before analysis. Often, the aggregation scale is large enough to
remove any short-memory components of the underlying process but too short to
eliminate seasonal patterns of much longer periods. In this paper, we
investigate the limiting correlation structure of aggregate time series within
an intermediate asymptotic framework that attempts to capture the
aforementioned sampling scheme. In particular, we study the autocorrelation
structure and the spectral density function of aggregates from a discrete-time
process. The underlying discrete-time process is assumed to be a stationary
Seasonal AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving-Average (SARFIMA)
process, after suitable number of differencing if necessary, and the seasonal
periods of the underlying process are multiples of the aggregation size. We
derive the limit of the normalized spectral density function of the aggregates,
with increasing aggregation. The limiting aggregate (seasonal) long-memory
model may then be useful for analyzing aggregate time-series data, which can be
estimated by maximizing the Whittle likelihood. We prove that the maximum
Whittle likelihood estimator (spectral maximum likelihood estimator) is
consistent and asymptotically normal, and study its finite-sample properties
through simulation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by a
real-life internet traffic example.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5513v1,math.ST

(TFT)-bootstrap, is proposed. Its basic idea is to bootstrap the Fourier
coefficients of the observed time series, and then to back-transform them to
obtain a bootstrap sample in the time domain. Related previous proposals, such
as the ""surrogate data"" approach, resampled only the phase of the Fourier
coefficients and thus had only limited validity. By contrast, we show that the
appropriate resampling of phase and magnitude, in addition to some smoothing of
Fourier coefficients, yields a bootstrap scheme that mimics the correct
second-order moment structure for a large class of time series processes. As a
main result we obtain a functional limit theorem for the TFT-bootstrap under a
variety of popular ways of frequency domain bootstrapping. Possible
applications of the TFT-bootstrap naturally arise in change-point analysis and
unit-root testing where statistics are frequently based on functionals of
partial sums. Finally, a small simulation study explores the potential of the
TFT-bootstrap for small samples showing that for the discussed tests in
change-point analysis as well as unit-root testing, it yields better results
than the corresponding asymptotic tests if measured by size and power.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4732v1,math.ST

forecasts. Uncertainty is often specified as point-wise error bars around a
mean or median forecast. Due to temporal dependencies, such a method obscures
some information. We would ideally have a way to query the posterior
probability of the entire time-series given the predictive variables, or at a
minimum, be able to draw samples from this distribution. We use a Bayesian
dictionary learning algorithm to statistically generate an ensemble of
forecasts. We show that the algorithm performs as well as a physics-based
ensemble method for temperature forecasts for Houston. We conclude that the
method shows promise for scenario forecasting where physics-based methods are

some nonstationary features into a stationary setup. We propose a new method to
identify the dimensionality of curve time series based on the dynamical
dependence across different curves. The practical implementation of our method
boils down to an eigenanalysis of a finite-dimensional matrix. Furthermore, the
determination of the dimensionality is equivalent to the identification of the
nonzero eigenvalues of the matrix, which we carry out in terms of some
bootstrap tests. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are investigated.
In particular, our estimators for zero-eigenvalues enjoy the fast convergence
rate n while the estimators for nonzero eigenvalues converge at the standard
$\sqrt{n}$-rate. The proposed methodology is illustrated with both simulated
and real data sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.2522v1,math.ST

statistical learning approach based on oracle inequalities. A series of papers
extends the oracle inequalities obtained for iid observations to time series
under weak dependence conditions. Given a family of predictors and $n$
observations, oracle inequalities state that a predictor forecasts the series
as well as the best predictor in the family up to a remainder term $\Delta_n$.
Using the PAC-Bayesian approach, we establish under weak dependence conditions
oracle inequalities with optimal rates of convergence. We extend previous
results for the absolute loss function to any Lipschitz loss function with
rates $\Delta_n\sim\sqrt{c(\Theta)/ n}$ where $c(\Theta)$ measures the
complexity of the model. We apply the method for quantile loss functions to
forecast the french GDP. Under additional conditions on the loss functions
(satisfied by the quadratic loss function) and on the time series, we refine
the rates of convergence to $\Delta_n \sim c(\Theta)/n$. We achieve for the
first time these fast rates for uniformly mixing processes. These rates are
known to be optimal in the iid case and for individual sequences. In
particular, we generalize the results of Dalalyan and Tsybakov on sparse
regression estimation to the case of autoregression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.1847v1,math.ST

v at time t (uv \in E(t)) represents the existence of a communications event
between actors u and v during the tth time period, we wish to detect anomalies
and/or change points. We consider a collection of graph features, or
invariants, and demonstrate that adaptive fusion provides superior inferential
efficacy compared to naive equal weighting for a certain class of anomaly
detection problems. Simulation results using a latent process model for time
series of graphs, as well as illustrative experimental results for a time
series of graphs derived from the Enron email data, show that a fusion

of functional data $(X_t\colon t\in\mathbb{Z})$. Such {\it functional time
series} frequently arise, e.g., when a continuous-time process is segmented
into some smaller natural units, such as days. Then each~$X_t$ represents one
intraday curve. We argue that functional principal component analysis (FPCA),
though a key technique in the field and a benchmark for any competitor, does
not provide an adequate dimension reduction in a time-series setting. FPCA
indeed is a {\it static} procedure which ignores the essential information
provided by the serial dependence structure of the functional data under study.
Therefore, inspired by Brillinger's theory of {\it dynamic principal
components}, we propose a {\it dynamic} version of FPCA, which is based on a

independently to each gene in a gene expression time series data set. Such sets
typically contain very few time points. Naive application of common GP
modelling techniques can lead to severe over-fitting or under-fitting in a
significant fraction of the fitted models, depending on the details of the data
set. We propose avoiding over-fitting by constraining the GP length-scale to
values that focus most of the energy spectrum to frequencies below the Nyquist
frequency corresponding to the sampling frequency in the data set.
Under-fitting can be avoided by more informative priors on observation noise.
Combining these methods allows applying GP methods reliably automatically to

past decade. A new approach for classification of time series uses
classification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted
from one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is
the time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The
search for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths
from all time series in the training set.
  A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets
space which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative
analysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields
the best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality
shapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized
shapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.

Existing contributions to this problem have largely focused on the special case

tractability and the current lack of advanced functional time series

can be utilized in this context. The connection between functional and
multivariate predictions is made precise for the important case of vector and
functional autoregressions. The proposed method is easy to implement, making
use of existing statistical software packages, and may therefore be attractive
to a broader, possibly non-academic, audience. Its practical applicability is
enhanced through the introduction of a novel functional final prediction error
model selection criterion that allows for an automatic determination of the lag
structure and the dimensionality of the model. The usefulness of the proposed
methodology is demonstrated in a simulation study and an application to

generating system. We study a class of functional models that we call Time
Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo). These models require independent

Theoretical: By restricting the model class (e.g. to additive noise) we can
provide a more general identifiability result than existing ones. This result
incorporates lagged and instantaneous effects that can be nonlinear and do not
need to be faithful, and non-instantaneous feedbacks between the time series.
(2) Practical: If there are no feedback loops between time series, we propose
an algorithm based on non-linear independence tests of time series. When the
data are causally insufficient, or the data generating process does not satisfy
the model assumptions, this algorithm may still give partial results, but

structure are based on nonparametric spectral stimation, which prevents
application of common model selection strategies. In this paper, we present a
parametric approach for graphical interaction modelling of multivariate
stationary time series. The proposed models generalize covariance selection
models to the time series setting and are formulated in terms of inverse
covariances. We show that these models correspond to vector autoregressive

2012-06-04 13:37:12+00:00,Factor modeling for high-dimensional time series: Inference for the number of factors,"['Clifford Lam', 'Qiwei Yao']","This paper deals with the factor modeling for high-dimensional time series
based on a dimension-reduction viewpoint. Under stationary settings, the
inference is simple in the sense that both the number of factors and the factor
loadings are estimated in terms of an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite
matrix, and is therefore applicable when the dimension of time series is on the
order of a few thousands. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are
investigated under two settings: (i) the sample size goes to infinity while the
dimension of time series is fixed; and (ii) both the sample size and the
dimension of time series go to infinity together. In particular, our estimators
for zero-eigenvalues enjoy faster convergence (or slower divergence) rates,
hence making the estimation for the number of factors easier. In particular,
when the sample size and the dimension of time series go to infinity together,
the estimators for the eigenvalues are no longer consistent. However, our
estimator for the number of the factors, which is based on the ratios of the
estimated eigenvalues, still works fine. Furthermore, this estimation shows the
so-called ""blessing of dimensionality"" property in the sense that the
performance of the estimation may improve when the dimension of time series
increases. A two-step procedure is investigated when the factors are of
different degrees of strength. Numerical illustration with both simulated and
real data is also reported.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0613v1,math.ST

tools used in learning theory with iid observations can be extended to the

family of predictors, we are able to build a new predictor that predicts the

$1/\sqrt{n}$. It is known that this rate cannot be improved in general. In this
paper, we show that in the particular case of the least square loss, and under
a strong assumption on the time series (phi-mixing) the remainder is actually
of order $1/n$. Thus, the optimal rate for iid variables, see e.g. Tsybakov

variables and $T$ observations) by hard thresholding regularization as long as
${{\log J \, \cx^*(\ct)}}/{T} = \Co(1)$ (the former scheme with some time
dependence measure $\cx^*(\ct)$) or $\log J /{T} = \Co(1)$ (the latter scheme

history. However, with regard to this objective, conventional estimation
methods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting.
In fact, they are characteristically misguided in at least two respects: (i)
assuming that there is a true model; (ii) evaluating the efficacy of the
estimation as if the postulated model is true. There are numerous examples of
models, when fitted by conventional methods, that fail to capture some of the
most basic global features of the data, such as cycles with good matching
periods, singularities of spectral density functions (especially at the origin)
and others. We argue that the shortcomings need not always be due to the model
formulation but the inadequacy of the conventional fitting methods. After all,
all models are wrong, but some are useful if they are fitted properly. The
practical issue becomes one of how to best fit the model to data. Thus, in the
absence of a true model, we prefer an alternative approach to conventional
model fitting that typically involves one-step-ahead prediction errors. Our
primary aim is to match the joint probability distribution of the observable
time series, including long-term features of the dynamics that underpin the
data, such as cycles, long memory and others, rather than short-term
prediction. For want of a better name, we call this specific aim feature

series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for
multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we
consider the likelihood function p_{\theta}(x) of different parameters \theta
in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and
x', we form the product of their features p_{\theta}(x) p_{\theta}(x') which is
integrated out w.r.t \theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among
other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of
the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x
and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary
state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel
\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram
matrices produced by \kappa on observations and subsequences of observations
enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation
of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques.
These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark
classification tasks carried out with support vector machines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.0673v1,stat.ML

established for I(1) processes, a rich class of stationary processes, possibly
affected by local nonpara- metric alternatives, and the local-to-unity model.
Further, we consider the two interesting change-point models where the time

light-curves (photometric time series data from the astrophysics domain).
Separating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important step
towards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects. Most anomaly
detection methods for time series data assume either a single continuous time
series or a set of time series whose periods are aligned. Light-curve data
precludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair of
light-curves may be out of sync. One may use an existing anomaly detection
method if, prior to similarity calculation, one performs the costly act of
aligning two light-curves, an operation that scales poorly to massive data
sets. This paper presents PCAD, an unsupervised anomaly detection method for
large sets of unsynchronized periodic time-series data, that outputs a ranked
list of both global and local anomalies. It calculates its anomaly score for
each light-curve in relation to a set of centroids produced by a modified
k-means clustering algorithm. Our method is able to scale to large data sets

goodness-of-fit test to the long memory case. Under the null hypothesis of

2008-04-07 14:31:30+00:00,On the Spectral Properties of Matrices Associated with Trend Filters,"['Alessandra Luati', 'Tommaso Proietti']","This paper is concerned with the spectral properties of matrices associated
with linear filters for the estimation of the underlying trend of a time
series. The interest lies in the fact that the eigenvectors can be interpreted
as the latent components of any time series that the filter smooths through the
corresponding eigenvalues. A difficulty arises because matrices associated with
trend filters are finite approximations of Toeplitz operators and therefore
very little is known about their eigenstructure, which also depends on the
boundary conditions or, equivalently, on the filters for trend estimation at
the end of the sample. Assuming reflecting boundary conditions, we derive a
time series decomposition in terms of periodic latent components and
corresponding smoothing eigenvalues. This decomposition depends on the local
polynomial regression estimator chosen for the interior. Otherwise, the
eigenvalue distribution is derived with an approximation measured by the size
of the perturbation that different boundary conditions apport to the
eigenvalues of matrices belonging to algebras with known spectral properties,
such as the Circulant or the Cosine. The analytical form of the eigenvectors is
then derived with an approximation that involves the extremes only. A further
topic investigated in the paper concerns a strategy for a filter design in the
time domain. Based on cut-off eigenvalues, new estimators are derived, that are
less variable and almost equally biased as the original estimator, based on all
the eigenvalues. Empirical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1040v2,math.ST

of moving block bootstrap for non-stationary time series with periodic and

expectation function. Consistency holds in quite general situations: if all
joint distributions of the series are periodic, then it suffices to assume the
central limit theorem and strong mixing property, together with summability of
the autocovariance function. In the case where the mean function is almost
periodic, we additionally need uniform boundedness of the fourth moments of the

synchronization) between any number of multivariate time series are defined.
The measures are expressed as the sum of lagged dependence and instantaneous
dependence. The measures are non-negative, and take the value zero only when
there is independence of the pertinent type. These measures are defined in the
frequency domain and are applicable to stationary and non-stationary time
series. These new results extend and refine significantly those presented in a
previous technical report (Pascual-Marqui 2007, arXiv:0706.1776 [stat.ME],

paper on linear feedback by Geweke (1982 JASA 77:304-313). One important field
of application is neurophysiology, where the time series consist of electric
neuronal activity at several brain locations. Coherence and phase
synchronization are interpreted as ""connectivity"" between locations. However,
any measure of dependence is highly contaminated with an instantaneous,
non-physiological contribution due to volume conduction and low spatial
resolution. The new techniques remove this confounding factor considerably.
Moreover, the measures of dependence can be applied to any number of brain

applied economics. The basic motivation resides in their capability of reducing
a large set of time series to only few indicators (factors). If the number of
time series is large compared to the available number of observations then most
information may be conveyed to the factors. This way low dimension models may
be estimated for explaining and forecasting one or more time series of
interest. It is desirable that outlier free time series be available for
estimation. In practice, outlying observations are likely to arise at unknown
dates due, for instance, to external unusual events or gross data entry errors.
Several methods for outlier detection in time series are available. Most
methods, however, apply to univariate time series while even methods designed
for handling the multivariate framework do not include dynamic factor models
explicitly. A method for discovering outliers occurrences in a dynamic factor
model is introduced that is based on linear transforms of the observed data.
Some strategies to separate outliers that add to the model and outliers within

different spatial locations are usually interpreted as indicators of the
connectivity between locations. In neurophysiology, time series of electric
neuronal activity are essential for studying brain interconnectivity. Such
signals can either be invasively measured from depth electrodes, or computed
from very high time resolution, non-invasive, extracranial recordings of scalp
electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and magnetic fields
(MEG: magnetoencephalogram) by means of a tomography such as sLORETA
(standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). There are two
problems in this case. First, in the usual situation of unknown cortical
geometry, the estimated signal at each brain location is a vector with three
components (i.e. a current density vector), which means that coherence and
phase synchronization must be generalized to pairs of multivariate time series.
Second, the inherent low spatial resolution of the EEG/MEG tomography
introduces artificially high zero-lag coherence and phase synchronization. In
this report, solutions to both problems are presented. Two additional
generalizations are briefly mentioned: (1) conditional coherence and phase
synchronization; and (2) non-stationary time-frequency analysis. Finally, a
non-parametric randomization method for connectivity significance testing is
outlined. The new connectivity measures proposed here can be applied to pairs
of univariate EEG/MEG signals, as is traditional in the published literature.

approximation of the difference between the real change-point and its

nonstationarity does not invalid the classical concerns of structural equation
modeling -- identification and simultaneity bias. The same rank condition for
identification holds for stationary and nonstationary data and some sort of
instrumental variable estimators will have to be employed to yield consistency.
However, nonstationarity does raise issues of inference if the rank of
cointegration or direction of nonstationarity is not known a priori. The usual

$X_t=Z_t-\theta_0Z_{t-1}$, with independent and identically distributed
$\{Z_t\}$. This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write
down. The MA(1) with unit root ($\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of
time series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of
a linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)
with unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced
series is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The
unit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which
the signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)
model and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a
constant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian
likelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case
($\theta=1+\beta/n,\beta\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these
estimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in
which P$(\hat{\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for
this pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\theta$ in the
Gaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two
sets of parameter values $(\theta,\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\theta,\theta^2\sigma^2$).
It follows that $\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood
function. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\theta$ is identifiable for all
real values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up
phenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on
limiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\theta_0$ based on a Laplace
likelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute
Deviation (LAD) estimates. Simulation results illustrate the limit theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0702762v1,math.ST

of weakly dependent series are investigated including the Doukhan & Louhichi
(1999)'s $\eta$-weak dependence condition, and the $\tilde \phi$-dependence of
Dedecker & Prieur (2005). We thus obtain results for Markov chains, dynamical
systems, bilinear models, non causal Moving Average... From a moment inequality
of Doukhan & Louhichi (1999), we provide convergence rates of the term of error
for the estimation with the $\L^q$ loss or almost surely, uniformly on compact
subsets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0603254v2,math.ST

$d\in\mathbb{R}$. This time series is either stationary or can be made
stationary after differencing a finite number of times. We study the ""Local
Whittle Wavelet Estimator"" of the memory parameter $d$. This is a wavelet-based
semiparametric pseudo-likelihood maximum method estimator. The estimator may
depend on a given finite range of scales or on a range which becomes infinite
with the sample size. We show that the estimator is consistent and rate optimal
if $X$ is a linear process and is asymptotically normal if $X$ is Gaussian.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0601070v4,math.ST
2005-08-16 10:53:52+00:00,Efficiency improvements in inference on stationary and nonstationary fractional time series,['P. M. Robinson'],"We consider a time series model involving a fractional stochastic component,
whose integration order can lie in the stationary/invertible or nonstationary
regions and be unknown, and an additive deterministic component consisting of a
generalized polynomial. The model can thus incorporate competing descriptions
of trending behavior. The stationary input to the stochastic component has
parametric autocorrelation, but innovation with distribution of unknown form.
The model is thus semiparametric, and we develop estimates of the parametric
component which are asymptotically normal and achieve an M-estimation
efficiency bound, equal to that found in work using an adaptive LAM/LAN
approach. A major technical feature which we treat is the effect of truncating
the autoregressive representation in order to form innovation proxies. This is
relevant also when the innovation density is parameterized, and we provide a
result for that case also. Our semiparametric estimates employ nonparametric
series estimation, which avoids some complications and conditions in kernel
approaches featured in much work on adaptive estimation of time series models;
our work thus also contributes to methods and theory for nonfractional time
series models, such as autoregressive moving averages. A Monte Carlo study of
finite sample performance of the semiparametric estimates is included.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0508284v1,math.ST
2005-05-25 04:46:35+00:00,zoo: S3 Infrastructure for Regular and Irregular Time Series,"['A. Zeileis', 'G. Grothendieck']","zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally
ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series. Its key design
goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency
with base R and the ""ts"" class for regular time series. This paper describes
how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the
available methods for ""zoo"" objects which include plotting, merging and
binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and
index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass ""zooreg"" embeds regular time series
into the ""zoo"" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular
time series classes in R.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505527v1,math.ST
2005-05-10 10:01:59+00:00,A Functional Wavelet-Kernel Approach for Continuous-time Prediction,"['Anestis Antoniadis', 'Efstathios Paparoditis', 'Theofanis Sapatinas']","We consider the prediction problem of a continuous-time stochastic process on
an entire time-interval in terms of its recent past. The approach we adopt is
based on functional kernel nonparametric regression estimation techniques where
observations are segments of the observed process considered as curves. These
curves are assumed to lie within a space of possibly inhomogeneous functions,
and the discretized times series dataset consists of a relatively small,
compared to the number of segments, number of measurements made at regular
times. We thus consider only the case where an asymptotically non-increasing
number of measurements is available for each portion of the times series. We
estimate conditional expectations using appropriate wavelet decompositions of
the segmented sample paths. A notion of similarity, based on wavelet
decompositions, is used in order to calibrate the prediction. Asymptotic
properties when the number of segments grows to infinity are investigated under
mild conditions, and a nonparametric resampling procedure is used to generate,
in a flexible way, valid asymptotic pointwise confidence intervals for the
predicted trajectories. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed functional
wavelet-kernel methodology in finite sample situations by means of three
real-life datasets that were collected from different arenas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505172v1,math.ST
2004-12-01 16:32:49+00:00,Mining Heterogeneous Multivariate Time-Series for Learning Meaningful Patterns: Application to Home Health Telecare,"['Florence Duchene', 'Catherine Garbay', 'Vincent Rialle']","For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for
researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which
require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any
deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected
situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of
several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining
heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. The
proposed approach allows for mixed time-series -- containing both pattern and
non-pattern data -- such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and
global translating of patterns instances in time. We present the early results
of our approach in the context of monitoring the health status of a person at
home. The purpose is to build a behavioral profile of a person by analyzing the
time variations of several quantitative or qualitative parameters recorded
through a provision of sensors installed in the home.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0412003v1,cs.LG
